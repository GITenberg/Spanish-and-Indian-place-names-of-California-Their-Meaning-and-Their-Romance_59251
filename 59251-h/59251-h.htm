THE NAMES OF THE STATES AND TERRITORIES THEMSELVES

HIS VERSE WILL BE ENRICHED, HIS PAGES SING SPONTANEOUSLY,
WITH THE NAMES OF STATES AND CITIES

<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>

<p>This volume has been prepared in the hope
that it may serve, not only as a source of entertainment
to our own people, but also as a useful
handbook for the schools, and as a sort of tourist’s
guide for those who visit the state in such
numbers, and who almost invariably exhibit a
lively interest in our Spanish and Indian place
names.</p>

<p>We of California are doubly rich in the matter
of names, since, in addition to the Indian nomenclature
common to all the states, we possess the
splendid heritage left us by those bold adventurers
from Castile who first set foot upon our
shores. In these names the spirit of our romantic
past still lives and breathes, and their sound is
like an echo coming down the years to tell of that
other day when the savage built his bee-hive huts
on the river-banks, and the Spanish caballero
jingled his spurs along the Camino Real.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>And in what manner, it may well be asked,
have we been caring for this priceless heritage,—to
keep it pure, to preserve its inspiring history,
to present it in proper and authentic form for the
instruction and entertainment of “the stranger
within our gates,” as well as for the education of
our own youth? As the most convincing answer
to this question, some of the numerous errors in
works purporting to deal with this subject, many
of which have even crept into histories and books
for the use of schools, will be corrected in these
pages.</p>

<p>In the belief that the Spanish and Indian names
possess the greatest interest for the public, both
“tenderfoot” and native, they will be dealt with
here almost exclusively, excepting a very few of
American origin, whose stories are so involved
with the others that they can scarcely be omitted.
In addition, there are a number that appear to
be of Anglo-Saxon parentage, but are in reality
to be counted among those that have suffered
the regrettable fate of translation into English
from the original Spanish. Of such are Kings
County and River, which took their names from
<i>El Río de los Santos Reyes</i> (the River of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Kings), and the Feather River, originally <i>El Río
de las Plumas</i> (the River of the Feathers).</p>

<p>While searching for the beginnings of these
names through the diaries of the early Spanish
explorers and other sources, a number of curious
stories have been encountered, which are shared
with the reader in the belief that he will be glad
to know something of the romance lying behind
the nomenclature of our “songful, tuneful” land.</p>

<p>It is a matter of deep regret that the work
must of necessity be incomplete, the sources of
information being so scattered, and so often unreliable,
that it has been found impossible to trace
all the names to their origin.</p>

<p>Indian words are especially difficult; in fact,
as soon as we enter that field we step into the
misty land of legend, where all becomes doubt
and uncertainty. That such should be the case
is inevitable. Scientific study of the native Californian
languages, of which there were so many as
to constitute a veritable Babel of tongues among
the multitude of small tribes inhabiting this region,
was begun in such recent times that but few aborigines
were left to tell the story of their names,
and those few retained but a dim memory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
old days. In view of the unsatisfactory nature
of this information, stories of Indian origin will
be told here with the express qualification that
their authenticity is not vouched for, except in
cases based upon scientific evidence. Some of the
most romantic among them, when put to the
“acid test” of such investigation, melt into thin
air. In a general way, it may be said that Indian
names were usually derived from villages, rather
than tribes, and that, in most cases, their meaning
has been lost.</p>

<p>In the case of Spanish names, we have a rich
mine in the documents left behind by the methodical
Spaniards, who maintained the praiseworthy
custom of keeping minute accounts of their travels
and all circumstances connected therewith. From
these sources the true stories of the origin of some
of our place names have been collected, and are
retold in these pages, as far as possible, in the
language of their founders. Unfortunately, the
story can not always be run to earth, and in such
cases, the names, with their translation, and
sometimes an explanatory paragraph, will appear
in a supplementary list at the end of the volume.
The stories have been arranged in a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
groups, according to their geographical location,
beginning with San Diego as the most logical
point, since it was there that the first mission was
established by the illustrious Junípero Serra, and
there that the history of California practically
began. The arrangement of these groups is not
arbitrary, but, in a general way, follows the course
of Spanish Empire, as it took its way, first up the
coast, then branching out into the interior valley,
and climbing the Sierras.</p>

<p>Some of the stories may appear as “twice-told
tales” to scholars and other persons to whom they
have long been familiar, but are included here for
the benefit of the stranger and the many “native
sons” who have had no opportunity to become
acquainted with them.</p>

<p>A few words in regard to the method of naming
places customary among the Spanish explorers
may help the reader to a better understanding of
results. The military and religious members of
the parties were naturally influenced by opposite
ideas, and so they went at it in two different ways.
The padres, as a matter of course, almost invariably
chose names of a religious character, very
often the name of the saint upon whose “day”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the party happened to arrive at a given spot.
This tendency resulted in the multitude of <i>Sans</i>
and <i>Santas</i> with which the map of our state is so
generously sprinkled, and which are the cause of
a certain monotony. Fortunately for variety’s
sake, the soldiers possessed more imagination, if
less religion, than the padres, and were generally
influenced by some striking circumstance, perhaps
trivial or humorous, but always characteristic,
and often picturesque. In many cases the
choice of the soldiers has out-lived that of the
fathers.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, it may be said that names
were first applied to rivers, creeks or mountains,
as being those natural features of the country
most important to the welfare, or even the very
existence, of the exploring parties. For instance,
the <i>Merced</i> (Mercy), River was so-called because
it was the first drinking water encountered by the
party after having traversed forty miles of the hot,
dry valley. Then, as time passed and the country
developed, towns were built upon the banks
of these streams, frequently receiving the
same names, and these were often finally adopted
to designate the counties established later in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
regions through which their waters flow. In this
way Plumas County derived its name from the
Feather River, originally <i>El Río de las Plumas</i>,
and Kings County from <i>El Río de los Reyes</i> (the
River of the Kings). This way of naming was,
however, not invariable.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the name has disappeared
from the map, while the story remains,
and some such stories will be told, partly for their
own interest, and partly for the light they throw
upon a past age.</p>

<p>Among our Spanish names there is a certain
class given to places in modern times by Americans
in a praiseworthy attempt to preserve the
romantic flavor of the old days. Unfortunately,
an insufficient knowledge of the syntax and
etymology of the Spanish language has resulted
in some improper combinations. Such names, for
instance, as <i>Monte Vista</i> (Mountain or Forest
View), <i>Loma Vista</i> (Hill View), <i>Río Vista</i> (River
View), etc., grate upon the ears of a Spaniard,
who would never combine two nouns in this way.
The correct forms for these names would be
<i>Vista del Monte</i> (View of the Mountain), <i>Vista de
la Loma</i> (View of the Hill), <i>Vista del Río</i> (View<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the River), etc. Between this class of modern
Spanish names, more or less faulty in construction,
given by “Spaniards from Kansas,” as has
been humorously said, and the real old names of
the Spanish epoch about which a genuine halo of
romance still clings, there is an immense gulf.</p>

<p>In the numerous quotations used in this book,
the language of the original has generally been
retained, with no attempt to change the form of
expression. In spite of the most conscientious
efforts to avoid them, unreliability of sources may
cause some errors to find their way into these
pages; for these the author hopes not to be held
responsible.</p>

<span class="smaller">CALIFORNIA</span></h2>

<p>First comes the name of <i>California</i> herself,
the <i>sin par</i> (peerless one), as Don Quixote says
of his Dulcinea. This name, strange to say,
was a matter of confusion and conjecture for
many years, until, in 1862, Edward Everett Hale
accidentally hit upon the explanation since accepted
by historians.</p>

<p>Several theories, all more or less fanciful and
far-fetched, were based upon the supposed construction
of the word from the Latin <i>calida fornax</i>
(hot oven), in reference either to the hot, dry
climate of Lower California, or to the “sweathouses”
in use among the Indians. Such theories
not only presuppose a knowledge of Latin not
likely to exist among the hardy men who first
landed upon our western shores but also indicate
a labored method of naming places quite contrary
to their custom of seizing upon some direct and
obvious circumstance upon which to base their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
choice. In all the length and breadth of California
few, if any, instances exist where the Spaniards
invented a name produced from the Latin or
Greek in this far-fetched way. They saw a big
bird, so they named the river where they saw it
<i>El Río del Pájaro</i> (the River of the Bird), or they
suffered from starvation in a certain canyon, so
they called it <i>La Cañada del Hambre</i> (the Canyon
of Hunger), or they reached a place on a certain
saint’s day, and so they named it for that saint.
They were practical men and their methods were
simple.</p>

<p>In any case, since Mr. Hale has provided us
with a more reasonable explanation, all such
theories may be passed over as unworthy of consideration.
While engaged in the study of Spanish
literature, he was fortunate enough to run across
a copy of an old novel, published in Toledo sometime
between 1510 and 1521, in which the word
<i>California</i> occurred as the name of a fabulous
island, rich in minerals and precious stones, and
said to be the home of a tribe of Amazons. This
novel, entitled <i>Las Sergas de Esplandián</i> (The
Adventures of Esplandián), was written by the
author, García Ordonez de Montalvo, as a sequel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to the famous novel of chivalry, <i>Amadís of Gaul</i>,
of which he was the translator. The two works
were printed in the same volume. Montalvo’s
romance, although of small literary value, had a
considerable vogue among Spanish readers of the
day, and that its pages were probably familiar
to the early explorers in America is proved by the
fact that Bernal Díaz, one of the companions of
Cortés, often mentions the Amadís, to which the
story of Esplandián was attached. The passage
containing the name that has since become famous
in all the high-ways and by-ways of the world
runs as follows: “Know that on the right hand
of the Indies there is an island called <i>California</i>,
very near to the terrestrial paradise, which was
peopled by black women, without any men among
them, for they were accustomed to live after the
manner of Amazons. They were of strong and
hardened bodies, of ardent courage and of great
force. The island was the strongest in the world,
from its steep rocks and great cliffs. Their arms
were all of gold and so were the caparisons of the
wild beasts they rode.”</p>

<p>It was during the period when this novel was
at the height of its popularity that Cortés wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the King of Spain concerning information he
had of “an island of Amazons, or women only,
abounding in pearls and gold, lying ten days
journey from Colima.” After having sent one
expedition to explore the unknown waters in that
direction, in 1535 or thereabout, an expedition
that ended in disaster, he went himself and
planted a colony at a point, probably La Paz,
on the coast of Lower California. In his diary of
this expedition, Bernal Díaz speaks of California
as a “bay,” and it is probable that the name was
first applied to some definite point on the coast,
afterward becoming the designation of the whole
region. The name also occurs in Preciado’s diary
of Ulloa’s voyage down the coast in 1539, making
it reasonable to suppose that it was adopted in the
period between 1535 and 1539, whether by Cortés
or some other person can not be ascertained.</p>

<p>Bancroft expresses the opinion that the followers
of Cortés may have used the name in derision,
to express their disappointment in finding a
desert, barren land in lieu of the rich country of
their expectations, but it seems far more in keeping
with the sanguine nature of the Spaniards that
their imaginations should lead them to draw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
parallel between the rich island of the novel, with
its treasures of gold and silver, and the new land,
of whose wealth in pearls and precious metals
some positive proof, as well as many exaggerated
tales, had reached them.</p>

<p>An argument that seems to clinch the matter
of the origin of the name is the extreme improbability
that two different persons, on opposite
sides of the world, should have invented exactly
the same word, at about the same period, especially
such an unusual one as <i>California</i>.</p>

<p>As for the etymology of the word itself, it is as
yet an unsolved problem. The suggestion that
it is compounded of the Greek root <i>kali</i> (beautiful),
and the Latin <i>fornix</i> (vaulted arch), thus making
its definition “beautiful sky,” may be the true
explanation, but even if that be so, Cortés or his
followers took it at second hand from Montalvo
and were not its original inventors.</p>

<p>Professor George Davidson, in a monograph on
the <i>Origin and the Meaning of the Name California</i>,
states that incidental mention had been made as
early as 1849 of the name as occurring in
Montalvo’s novel by George Ticknor, in his
<i>History of Spanish Literature</i>, but Mr. Ticknor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
refers to it simply as literature, without any
thought of connecting it with the name of the
state. This connection was undoubtedly first
thought of by Mr. Hale and was discussed in his
paper read before the Historical Society of
Massachusetts in 1862; therefore the honor of the
discovery of the origin of the state’s name must
in justice be awarded to him. Professor Davidson,
in an elaborate discussion of the possible etymology
of the word, expresses the opinion that it may be a
combination of two Greek words, <i>kallos</i> (beauty),
and <i>ornis</i> (bird), in reference to the following
passage in the book: “In this island are many
griffins, which can be found in no other part of
the world.” Its etymology, however, is a matter
for further investigation. The one fact that seems
certain is its origin in the name of the fabulous
island of the novel.</p>

<p>It may well suffice for the fortunate heritors of
the splendid principality now known as <i>California</i>
that this charming name became affixed to it
permanently, rather than the less “tuneful” one
of <i>New Albion</i>, which Sir Francis Drake applied
to it, and under which cognomen it appears on
some English maps of the date.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN AND ABOUT SAN DIEGO</span></h2>

<p>Like many other places in California, <i>San
Diego</i> (St. James), has had more than one
christening. The first was at the hands of
Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who discovered the
harbor in 1542, and named it <i>San Miguel</i> (St.
Michael). Cabrillo was a Portuguese in the
Spanish service, who was sent to explore the
coast in 1542 by Viceroy Mendoza. “He sailed
from Natividad with two vessels, made a careful
survey, applied names that for the most part
have not been retained, and described the coast
somewhat accurately as far as Monterey. He
discovered ‘a land-locked and very good harbor,’
probably San Diego, which he named San
Miguel. ‘The next day he sent a boat farther
into the port, which was large. A very great
gale blew from the west-southwest, and south-southwest,
but the port being good, they felt
nothing.’ On the return from the north the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
party stopped at La Posesión, where Cabrillo
died on January third, from the effects of a fall
and exposure. No traces of his last resting-place,
almost certainly on San Miguel near Cuyler’s
harbor, have been found; and the drifting sands
have perhaps made such a discovery doubtful.
To this bold mariner, the first to discover her
coasts, if to any one, California may with propriety
erect a monument.”—(Bancroft’s <i>History
of California</i>.)</p>

<p class="caption">MISSION OF SAN DIEGO DE ALCALÁ, FOUNDED IN 1769.</p>
<p class="caption">“The first one of the chain of missions founded by the illustrious Junípero Serra.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, in 1602, came Sebastián Vizcaíno, who
changed the name from San Miguel to San Diego.
He was “sent to make the discovery and demarcation
of the ports and bays of the Southern Sea
(Pacific Ocean),” and to occupy for Spain the
California isles, as they were then thought to be.
From the diary of Vizcaíno’s voyage we get the
following account of his arrival at San Diego:
“The next day, Sunday, the tenth of the said
month (November), we arrived at a port, the best
that there can be in all the Southern Sea, for,
besides being guarded from all winds, and having
a good bottom, it is in latitude 33½. It has very
good water and wood, many fish of all sorts, of
which we caught a great many with the net and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hooks. There is good hunting of rabbits, hares,
deer, and many large quail, ducks and other
birds. On the twelfth of the said month, which
was the day of the glorious San Diego, the admiral,
the priests, the officers, and almost all the people,
went on shore. A hut was built, thus enabling
the feast of the Señor San Diego to be celebrated.”</p>

<p>A party sent out to get wood “saw upon a hill
a band of 100 Indians, with bows and arrows,
and many feathers upon their heads, and with a
great shouting they called out to us.” By a
bestowal of presents, friendly relations were
established. The account continues: “They had
pots in which they cooked their food, and the
Indian women were dressed in the skins of animals.
The name of <i>San Diego</i> was given to this port.”
Thus, it was the bay that first received the name,
years afterwards given to the mission, then to the
town. During the stay of Vizcaíno’s party the
Indians came often to their camp with marten
skins and other articles. On November 20,
having taken on food and water, the party set
sail, the Indians shouting a vociferous farewell
from the beach (<i>quedaban en la playa, dando
boces</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>A long period of neglect of more than 160 years
then ensued. The Indians continued to carry
on their wretched hand-to-mouth existence, trapping
wild beasts for their food and scanty clothing,
fishing in the teeming streams, and keeping
up their constant inter-tribal quarrels unmolested
by the white man. Several generations grew up
and passed away without a reminder of the strange
people who had once been seen upon their shores,
except perhaps an occasional white sail of some
Philippine galleon seen flitting like a ghost on its
southward trip along the coast.</p>

<p>Then the Spaniards, alarmed by reports of the
encroachments of the Russians on the north,
waked up from their long sleep, and determined
to establish a chain of missions along the California
coast. Father Junípero Serra was
appointed president of these missions, and the
first one of the chain was founded by him at San
Diego in 1769. The name was originally applied
to the “Old Town,” some distance from the
present city. The founding party encountered
great difficulties, partly through their fearful
sufferings from scurvy, and partly from the turbulent
and thievish nature of the Indians in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
vicinity, with whom they had several lively fights,
and who stole everything they could lay their
hands on, even to the sheets from the beds of the
sick. During one of these attacks, the mission
buildings were burned and one of the padres,
Fray Luís Jaime, suffered a cruel death, but all
difficulties were finally overcome by the strong
hand of Father Serra, and the mission was placed
on a firm basis. Its partially ruined buildings
still remain at a place about six miles from the
present city.</p>

<p>To return to the matter of the name, San Diego
is doubly rich in possessing two titular saints,
the bay having been undoubtedly named by
Vizcaíno in honor of St. James, the patron saint
of Spain, whereas the town takes its name from
the mission, which perpetuates the memory of a
canonized Spanish monk, San Diego de Alcalá.
The story of St. James, the patron of Spain, runs
as follows: “As one of Christ’s disciples, a nobleman’s
son who chose to abandon his wealth and
follow Jesus, he was persecuted by the Jews, and
finally beheaded. When dragged before Herod
Agrippa, his gentleness touched the soul of one
of his tormentors, who begged to die with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
James gave him a kiss, saying ‘<i>Pax Vobiscum</i>’
(peace be with you), and from this arose the kiss
of peace which has been used in the church since
that time. The legend has it that his body was
conducted by angels to Spain, where a magnificent
church was built for its reception, and that his
spirit returned to earth and took an active part
in the military affairs of the country. He was said
to have appeared at the head of the Spanish armies
on thirty-eight different occasions, most notably
in 939, when King Ramírez determined not to
submit longer to the tribute of one hundred virgins
annually paid to the Moors, and defied them to
a battle. After the Spaniards had suffered one
repulse, the spirit of St. James appeared at their
head on a milk-white charger, and led them to a
victory in which sixty thousand Moors were left
dead on the field. From that day ‘Santiago!’ has
been the Spanish war-cry.”—(From Clara Erskine
Clement’s <i>Stories of the Saints</i>.)</p>

<p>It happens, rather curiously, that in the Spanish
language St. James appears under several different
forms, <i>Santiago</i>, <i>San Diego</i> and <i>San Tiago</i>. The
immediate patron of our southernmost city,
<i>San Diego de Alcalá</i>, was a humble Capuchin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
brother in a monastery of Alcalá. It is said that
the <i>infante</i> Don Carlos was healed of a severe
wound through the intercession of this saint, and
that on this account Philip II promoted his
canonization.</p>

<p>May the spirit of the “glorious San Diego”
shed some of his tender humanity upon the city
of which he is the protector!</p>

<h3>CORONADO BEACH</h3>

<p><i>Coronado Beach</i>, the long spit of land forming
the outer shore of the harbor of San Diego,
“derived its name from the Coronado Islands
near it. These islands were originally named by
the Spaniards in honor of Coronado. When the
improvement of the sand spit opposite San Diego
City and facing the Coronado Islands was made
in 1885, the name of Coronado Beach was bestowed
upon it.”—(Charles B. Turrill, San Francisco.)</p>

<p>In all the history of Spain in western America
there is nothing more romantic than the story of
the famous explorer, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
who, with the delightful childlike faith of
his race, marched through Texas and Kansas in
search of the fabulous city of <i>Gran Quivira</i>,
“where every one had his dishes made of wrought
plate, and the jugs and bowls were of gold,” and
then marched back again! Imagine our hard-headed
Puritan ancestors setting forth on such a
quest!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3>SAN LUÍS REY</h3>

<p><i>San Luís Rey de Francia</i> (St. Louis King of
France), is the name of the mission situated in a
charming little valley about forty miles north of
San Diego and three miles from the sea. It was
founded June 13, 1798, by Padres Lasuén, Santiago
and Peyri, and its ruins may still be seen
upon the spot. A partial restoration has been
made of these buildings and they are now used by
the Franciscans. The exact circumstances of its
naming have not come to light, but we know of
its patron saint that his holiness was such that
even Voltaire said of him: “It is scarcely given
to man to push virtue further.” Born at Poissy
in 1215, the son of Louis VIII and Blanche of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Castile, he became noted for his saintliness, and
twice led an army of Crusaders in the “holy war.”</p>

<h3>PALA</h3>

<p><i>Pala</i>, often misspelled <i>palo</i>, through an accidental
resemblance to the Spanish word <i>palo</i>
(stick or tree), is situated some fifteen miles or
more to the northeast of San Luís Rey, and is
the site of the sub-mission of San Antonio de Pala,
founded in 1816 by Padre Peyri as a branch of
San Luís Rey. This mission was unique in having
a bell-tower built apart from the church, and
many romantic stories have been told about the
“bells of Pala.” It was located in the center of a
populous Indian community, and it happens,
rather curiously, that the word itself has a significance
both in Spanish and Indian, meaning
in Spanish “spade” and in Indian “water.” The
Reverend George Doyle, pastor at the mission
of San Antonio de Pala, writes the following in
regard to this name: “The word ‘Pala’ is an
Indian word, meaning, in the Cupanian Mission
Indian language, ‘water,’ probably due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fact that the San Luís Rey River passes through
it. The proper title of the mission chapel here is
San Antonio de Padua, but as there is another
San Antonio de Padua mission chapel in the
north, to distinguish between the two some one
in the misty past changed the proper title of the
Saint, and so we have ‘de Pala’ instead of ‘de
Padua.’ Some writers say Pala is Spanish, but
this is not true, for the little valley in no way
resembles a spade, and the Palanian Indians were
here long before the Franciscan padres brought
civilization, Christianity and the Spanish
language.”</p>

<p><i>Pala</i>, in this case, is almost certainly Indian,
and originates in a legend of the Luiseños. According
to this legend, one of the natives of the Temécula
tribe went forth on his travels, stopping at
many places and giving names to them. One of
these places was a canyon, “where he drank water
and called it <i>pala</i>, water.”—(<i>The Religion of the
Luiseño Indians</i>, by Constance Goddard Dubois,
in the Univ. of Cal. Publ. of Arch. and Tech.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h3>SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO</h3>

<p><i>San Juan Capistrano</i> (St. John Capistrano),
was at one time sadly mutilated by having its
first part clipped off, appearing on the map as
<i>Capistrano</i>, but upon representations made by
Zoeth S. Eldredge it was restored to its full form
by the Post Office Department. A mission was
founded at this place, which is near the coast about
half-way between San Diego and Los Ángeles, by
Padres Serra and Amurrio, November 1, 1776,
the year of our own glorious memory. While on
the other side of the continent bloody war raged,
under the sunny skies of California the gentle
padres were raising altars to the “Man of Peace.”</p>

<p>The buildings at this place were badly wrecked
by an earthquake on December 8, 1812, yet the
ruins still remain to attest to the fact that this
was at one time regarded as the finest of all the
mission structures.</p>

<p>Its patron saint, St. John Capistrano, was a
Franciscan friar who lived at the time of the crusades,
and took part in them. A colossal statue
of him adorns the exterior of the Cathedral at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Vienna. It represents him as having a Turk under
his feet, a standard in one hand, and a cross in
the other.</p>

group of less importance, yet possessing many

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Agua Tibia</i> (warm water, warm springs), is in
San Diego County. For some reason difficult
to divine, this perfectly simple name has been the
cause of great confusion in the minds of a number
of writers. In one case the almost incredibly
absurd translation “shinbone water” has been
given. It may be thought that this was intended
as a bit of humor, but it is greatly to be feared
that the writer mixed up the Spanish word <i>tibia</i>,
which simply means “tepid, warm,” with the
Latin name of one of the bones of the lower leg,
the <i>tibia</i>. In another case the equally absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
translation “flute water” has been given. Where
such a meaning could have been obtained is beyond
comprehension to any person possessing
even a slight knowledge of the Spanish language.
<i>Agua Tibia</i> is no more nor less than “warm
water,” applied in this case to warm springs
existing at that place. This extreme case is enlarged
upon here as an example of the gross
errors that have been freely handed out to an
unsuspecting public in the matter of our place
names. There are many more of the same sort,
and the authors of this inexcusable stuff have
been accepted and even quoted as authorities
on the subject. Those of us who love our California,
in other words all of us, can not fail to be
pained by such a degradation of her romantic
history.</p>

<p><i>Ballena</i> (whale), is in San Diego County at the
west end of Ballena Valley, and as it is a good
many miles inland its name seems incongruous,
until we learn from one of its residents that it
was so-called in reference to a mountain in the
valley whose outline along the top is exactly
the shape of a humpbacked whale.</p>

<p>“This place has probably no connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Ballenas, a name applied to a bay in Lower California
on account of its being a favorite resort of
the Humpback whale.”—(Mr. Charles B. Turrill.)</p>

<p><i>Berenda</i>, in Merced County, is a misspelling of
Berrendo or Berrenda.</p>

<p><i>Berrendo</i> (antelope). A writer whose knowledge
of Spanish seems to be wholly a matter of the
dictionary, confused by the fact that the definition
given for <i>berrendo</i> is “having two colors,”
has offered the fantastic translation of <i>El Río de
los Berrendos</i> as “The River of two Colors.”
Although the idea of such a river, like a piece of
changeable silk, may be picturesque, the simple
truth is that the word <i>berrendo</i>, although not
so-defined in the dictionaries, is used in Spanish
America to signify a deer of the antelope variety
and frequently occurs in that sense in the diaries.
Miguel Costansó, an engineer accompanying the
Portolá expedition of 1769, says: “<i>Hay en la
tierra venados, verrendos</i> (also spelled <i>berrendos</i>),
<i>muchos liebres, conejos, gatos monteses y ratas</i>
(there are in the land deer, antelope, many hares,
rabbits, wild-cats and rats).” On August 4 this
party reached a place forty leagues from San Diego
which they called <i>Berrendo</i> because they caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
alive a deer which had been shot the day before
by the soldiers and had a broken leg. Antelope
Creek, in Tehama County, was originally named
<i>El Río de los Berrendos</i> (The River of the Antelopes),
undoubtedly because it was a drinking
place frequented by those graceful creatures,
and Antelope Valley, in the central part of the
state, must have received its name in the same
way.</p>

<p><i>El Cajón</i> (the box), about twelve miles northeast
of San Diego, perhaps received its name from
a custom the Spaniards had of calling a deep canyon
with high, box-like walls, <i>un cajón</i> (a box).</p>

<p><i>Caliente Creek</i> (hot creek), is in the northern
part of San Diego County.</p>

<p><i>Campo</i> (a level field), also sometimes used in
the sense of a camp, is the name of a place about
forty miles east-southeast of San Diego, just
above the Mexican border. <i>Campo</i> was an Indian
settlement, and may have been so-called by the
Spaniards simply in reference to the camp of
Indians.</p>

<p><i>Cañada del Bautismo</i> (glen of the baptism),
so-called from the circumstance that two dying
native children were there baptized by the padres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
as told in the diary of Miguel Costansó, of the
Portolá expedition of 1769. Death, when it
came to the children of the natives, was often
regarded as cause for rejoicing by the missionaries,
not, of course, through any lack of humanity
on their part, but because the Indian parents
more readily consented to baptism at such a
time, and the padres regarded these as so many
souls “snatched from the burning.”</p>

<p><i>Carriso</i> (reed grass), is the name of a village
and creek in San Diego County.</p>

<p><i>Chula Vista</i> (pretty view), is the name of a
town near the coast, a few miles southeast of San
Diego. <i>Chula</i> is a word of Mexican origin, meaning
pretty, graceful, attractive. “This name was
probably first used by the promoters during the
boom of 1887.”—(Mr. Charles B. Turrill.)</p>

<p><i>La Costa</i> (the coast), a place on the shore north
of San Diego.</p>

<p><i>Coyote Valley</i>, situated just below the southern
border of the San Jacinto Forest Reservation.
<i>Coyote</i>, the name of the wolf of Western America,
is an Aztec word, originally <i>coyotl</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cuyamaca</i> is probably derived from the land
grant of that name, which in turn took its name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from the Cuyamaca Mountain, which, according
to the scientists, was so-called in reference to the
clouds and rain gathering around its summit.
Mr. T. T. Waterman, instructor in Anthropology
at the University of California, says the word is
derived from two Indian words, <i>kwe</i> (rain), and
<i>amak</i> (yonder), and consequently means “rain
yonder.” The popular translation of it as
“woman’s breast” is probably not based on fact.
There was an Indian village of that name some
miles northwest of San Diego.</p>

<p><i>Descanso</i> (rest), is the name of a place northeast
of San Diego, so-called by a government
surveying party for the reason that they stopped
here each day for rest.</p>

<p><i>Dulzura</i> (sweetness), is the name of a place but
a few miles north of the Mexican border line.
What there was of “sweetness” in the history of
this desolate mining camp can not be discovered.</p>

<p><i>Encinitas</i> (little oaks), is a place on the coast
about twenty miles northwest of San Diego.</p>

<p><i>Escondido</i> (hidden), a place lying about fifteen
miles from the coast, to the northeast of San
Diego. It is said to have been so-named on
account of its location in the valley. A place at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
another point was called <i>Escondido</i> by the Spaniards
because of the difficulty they experienced
in finding the water for which they were anxiously
searching, and it may be that in this case the
origin of the name was the same.</p>

<p><i>La Jolla</i>, a word of doubtful origin, said by some
persons to mean a “pool,” by others to be from
<i>hoya</i>, a hollow surrounded by hills, and by
still others to be a possible corruption of <i>joya</i>, a
“jewel.” The suggestion has been made that La
Jolla was named from caves situated there which
contain pools, but until some further information
turns up this name must remain among the unsolved
problems. There is always the possibility
also that <i>La Jolla</i> means none of these things but
is a corruption of some Indian word with a totally
different meaning. More than one place in the
state masquerades under an apparently Spanish
name which is in reality an Indian word corrupted
into some Spanish word to which it bore
an accidental resemblance in sound. <i>Cortina</i>
(curtain) is an example of this sort of corruption,
it being derived from the Indian <i>Ko-tina</i>.</p>

<p><i>Laguna del Corral</i> (lagoon of the yard). <i>Corral</i>
is a word much in use to signify a space of ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
enclosed by a fence, often for the detention of
animals. In one of the diaries an Indian corral
is thus spoken of: “Near the place in which we
camped there was a populous Indian village; the
inhabitants lived without other protection than
a light shelter of branches in the form of an enclosure;
for this reason the soldiers gave to the
whole place the name of the <i>Ranchería del Corral</i>
(the village of the yard).” There are other <i>corrals</i>
and <i>corralitos</i> (little yards) in the state.</p>

<p><i>Linda Vista</i> (charming or pretty view), is the
name of a place ten or twelve miles due north of
San Diego.</p>

<p><i>Point Loma</i> (hill point). <i>Loma</i> means “hill,”
hence Point Loma, the very end of the little
peninsula enclosing San Diego bay, is a high
promontory.</p>

<p><i>De Luz</i> (a surname), that of a pioneer family.
The literal meaning of the word <i>luz</i> is “light.”</p>

<p><i>Del Mar</i> (of or on the sea), the name of a place
on the shore about eighteen miles north of San
Diego.</p>

<p><i>La Mesa</i> (literally “the table”), used very commonly
to mean “a high, flat table-land.” <i>La
Mesa</i>, incorrectly printed on some of the maps as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
one word, <i>Lamesa</i>, lies a few miles to the northeast
of San Diego.</p>

<p><i>Mesa Grande</i> (literally “big table”), big table-land,
is some distance to the northeast of San
Diego.</p>

<p><i>El Nido</i> (the nest), is southeast of San Diego,
near the border.</p>

<p><i>Potrero</i> (pasture ground), is just above the border
line. There are many <i>Potreros</i> scattered over
the state.</p>

<p><i>La Presa</i> (the dam or dike). <i>La Presa</i> is a few
miles east of San Diego, on the Sweetwater River,
no doubt called <i>Agua Dulce</i> by the Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>Los Rosales</i> (the rose-bushes), a spot located in
the narratives of the Spaniards at about seventeen
leagues from San Diego, and two leagues from
Santa Margarita. Nothing in the new land
brought to the explorers sweeter memories of
their distant home than “the roses of Castile”
which grew so luxuriantly along their pathway
as to bring forth frequent expressions of delight
from the padres. This particular place we find
mentioned in the diary of Miguel Costansó, as
follows: “We gave it the name of <i>Cañada de los
Rosales</i> (glen of the rose-bushes), on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the great number of rose-bushes we saw.”—(Translation
edited by Frederick J. Teggart,
Curator of the Academy of Pacific Coast History.)</p>

<p><i>Temécula</i>, the name of a once important Indian
village in the Temécula Valley, about thirty-five
miles south of Riverside. Its inhabitants suffered
the usual fate of the native when the white man
discovers the value of the land, and were compelled
to leave their valley in 1875, and remove to
Pichanga Canyon, in a desert region.</p>

<p><i>Tía Juana</i> (literally Aunt Jane). Travelers on
the way to Mexico who stop for customs examination
at this border town are no doubt surprised
by its peculiar name. This is an example of the
corruption, through its resemblance in sound, of
an Indian word, <i>Tiwana</i>, into <i>Tía Juana</i>, Spanish
for “Aunt Jane.” <i>Tiwana</i> is said to mean “by
the sea,” which may or may not be the correct
translation.</p>

<p><i>Los Ángeles</i> (the angels). In the diary of
Miguel Costansó, date of August 2, 1769, we
read: “To the north-northeast one could see another
water-course or river bed, which formed
a wide ravine, but it was dry. This water-course
joined that of the river, and gave clear indications
of heavy floods during the rainy season, as
it had many branches of trees and debris on its
sides. We halted at this place, which was named
<i>La Porciúncula</i>. Here we felt three successive
earthquakes during the afternoon and night.”—(Translation
edited by Frederick J. Teggart.)</p>

<p>This was the stream upon which the city of
Los Ángeles was subsequently built and whose
name became a part of her title. Porciúncula was
the name of a town and parish near Assisi which
became the abode of St. Francis de Assisi after
the Benedictine monks had presented him, about
1211, with the little chapel which he called, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
jocular way, <i>La Porciúncula</i> (the small portion).
By order of Pius V, in 1556 the erection of a new
edifice over the Porciúncula chapel was begun.
Under the bay of the choir is still preserved the
cell in which St. Francis died, while a little behind
the sacristy is the spot where the saint, during a
temptation, is said to have rolled in a brier-bush,
which was then changed into thornless roses.—(Catholic
Encyclopedia.) In this story there is
a curious interweaving of the history of the names
of our two rival cities, St. Francis in the north
and Los Ángeles de Porciúncula in the south.</p>

<p>Continuing their journey on the following day,
the Portolá party reached the Indian ranchería
(village) of <i>Yangna</i>, the site chosen for the pueblo
established at a later date. Father Crespi writes
of it thus: “We followed the road to the west,
and the good pasture land followed us; at about
half a league of travel we encountered the village
of this part; on seeing us they came out on the
road, and when we drew near they began to howl,
as though they were wolves; we saluted them,
they wished to give us some seeds, and as we had
nothing at hand in which to carry them, we did
not accept them; seeing this, they threw some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
handfuls on the ground and the rest in the
air.”</p>

<p>August 2 being the feast day of <i>Nuestra Señora
de los Ángeles</i>, as the Virgin Mary is often called
by the Spaniards, this name was given to the
place.</p>

<p>The actual founding of the pueblo did not occur
until September 4, 1781, when Governor Neve
issued the order for its establishment upon the
site of the Indian village Yangna. It is said that
the Porciúncula River, henceforth to be known as
the Los Ángeles, at that time ran to the east of
its present course. The name of the little stream
was added to that of the pueblo, so that the true,
complete title of the splendid city which has grown
up on the spot where the Indian once raised his
wolf-like howl is <i>Nuestra Señora la Reina de los
Ángeles de Porciúncula</i> (Our Lady the Queen
of the Angels of Porciúncula).</p>

<p>The social beginnings of Los Ángeles were
humble indeed, the first settlers being persons of
mixed race, and the first houses mere hovels,
made of adobe, with flat roofs covered with asphalt
from the springs west of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h3>EL RANCHO LA BREA</h3>

<p><i>La Brea</i> (the asphalt), has been retained as the
appropriate designation of the ranch containing
the famous asphaltum beds near Los Ángeles.
Ever since the days of the Tertiary Age, the quaking,
sticky surface of these beds has acted as a
“death trap” for unwary animals, and the remains
of the unfortunate creatures have been securely
preserved down to our times, furnishing indisputable
evidence of the strange life that once
existed on our shores. Fossils of a large number
of pre-historic and later animals have been taken
out, aggregating nearly a million specimens of
bird and animal life, many of them hitherto
unknown to science. Among them are the saber-tooth
tiger, gigantic wolves, bears, horses, bison,
deer, an extinct species of coyote, camels, elephants,
and giant sloths. Remains are also found
of mice, rabbits, squirrels, several species of
insects, and a large number of birds, such as
ducks, geese, pelicans, eagles and condors.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable of these fossils
are the saber-tooth tiger and the great wolf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Specimens of the wolf have been found which
are among the largest known in either living or
extinct species. This wolf differs from existing
species in having a larger and heavier skull and
jaws, and in its massive teeth, a conformation
that must have given it great crushing power.
The structure of the skeleton shows it to have
been probably less swift, but more powerful than
the modern wolf, and the great number of bones
found indicate that it was exceedingly common
in that age. One bed of bones was uncovered in
which the number of saber-tooth and wolf skulls
together averaged twenty per cubic yard. Altogether,
the disappearance of these great, ferocious
beasts from the California forests need cause no
keen regret.</p>

<p>Next to the large wolf the most common is the
saber-tooth tiger, of which one complete skeleton
and a large number of bones have been found.
The skeleton shows the animal to have been of
about the size of a large African lion, and its most
remarkable characteristic was the extraordinary
length of the upper canine teeth, which were like
long, thin sabers, with finely serrated edges.
These teeth were awkwardly placed for ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
use, and it is thought by scientists that they were
used for a downward stab through the thick necks
of bulky creatures, such as the giant sloth. There
is also an unusual development of the claws,
possibly to make up for the loss of grasping power
in the jaws, resulting from the interference of the
long saber teeth. It appears from the state of
many of the fossils that these teeth were peculiarly
liable to fracture, and accidents of this sort may
have led to the extinction of the species, the
animal thus perishing through the over-development
of one of its characteristics.</p>

<p>Fossils of the extinct horse and bison are common,
and a smaller number are found of camels,
deer, goats, and the mammoth. The bison were
heavy-horned and somewhat larger than the
existing species of buffalo. The camel, of which
an almost complete specimen has very recently
been taken out by Professor R. C. Stoner, of the
University of California, was much larger than the
present day species. Since the above was put in
type, a human skeleton has been taken from the
vicinity of the La Brea bed. Whether this skeleton
belongs with the La Brea deposits, and what
its comparative age in relation to other human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
remains may be, are matters now being investigated
by scientists.</p>

<p>The preponderance of meat-eating animals in
the La Brea beds has attracted the attention of
scientists, who believe that these creatures were
lured to the spot in large numbers by the struggles
and cries of their unfortunate prey caught in the
sticky mass of the tar. In this way, a single sloth,
or other creature, may have been the means of
bringing retribution upon a whole pack of wolves.—(Notes
taken from an article in the Sunset Magazine
of October, 1908, entitled <i>The Death Trap
of the Ages</i>, by John C. Merriam, Professor of
Paleontology in the University of California.)</p>

<p>The manner in which this great aggregation of
animals came to a tragic end in that long-past
age is exemplified in the way that birds and other
small animals are still occasionally caught in the
treacherous asphalt and there perish miserably,
adding their bones to those of their unhappy
predecessors.</p>

<p>The La Brea beds furnish one of the richest
fields for paleontological research to be found
anywhere in the world; and it may be said, that
with her great Sequoias in the north, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
reservoir of pre-historic remains in the south,
California stands as a link between a past age and
the present.</p>

<p>The tarry deposit itself has its own place in
history, for it appears that the first settlers of
Los Ángeles were alive to the practical value of
this supply of asphaltum lying ready to their
hands, and used it in roofing their houses. Even
the Indians, little as is the credit usually given
them for skill in the arts and crafts, recognized
the possibilities of this peculiar substance, and
used it in calking their canoes.</p>

<h3>LOS OJITOS</h3>

<p>The story of <i>Los Ojitos</i> (literally “little eyes”),
but here used in the sense of “little springs,”
situated about two leagues from Santa Ana,
indicates that the pleasures of social intercourse
were not altogether lacking among the California
Indians. In the diary of Miguel Costansó, of
the date of their arrival at this place, he writes:
“We found no water for the animals, but there
was sufficient for the people in some little springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
or small pools, in a narrow canyon close to
a native village. The Indians of this village
were holding a feast and dance, to which they had
invited their relatives of the <i>Río de los Temblores</i>
(River of the Earthquakes, or Santa Ana).”—(Translation
edited by Frederick J. Teggart.)
During this time the travelers experienced a
series of earthquakes lasting several days.</p>

<p><i>Ojo de agua</i> was commonly used by the Spaniards
to mean a spring, but during the eighteenth
century it was frequently used in America in the
sense of a small stream of water rather than a
spring.</p>

<h3>SANTA ANA</h3>

<p>On the day, Friday, July 28, 1769, of the arrival
of the Portolá expedition at the stream now called
the <i>Santa Ana</i>, which takes its rise in the San
Bernardino Mountains, and empties into the ocean
at a point southeast of Los Ángeles, four severe
earthquakes occurred. Speaking of this circumstance
in his diary, Father Crespi says: “To this
spot was given <i>El Dulce Nombre de Jesús de los
Temblores</i> (The Sweet Name of Jesus of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Earthquakes), because of having experienced
here a frightful earthquake, which was repeated
four times during the day. The first, which was
the most violent, happened at one o’clock of the
afternoon, and the last about four o’clock. One
of the <i>gentiles</i> (unbaptized Indians), who happened
to be in the camp, and who, without doubt,
exercised among them the office of priest, no less
terrified at the event than we, began, with horrible
cries and great demonstrations, to entreat Heaven,
turning to all points of the compass. This river
is known to the soldiers as the <i>Santa Ana</i>.” This
was one of the rare cases where the usual method
of naming was reversed, and the soldiers chose
the name of the saint. St. Anna was the mother
of the Virgin and her name signifies “gracious.”</p>

<p>In the account of Captain Pedro Fages, of the
same expedition, the natives on this stream are
described as having light complexions and hair,
and a good appearance, differing in these particulars
from the other inhabitants of that region,
who were said to be dark, dirty, under-sized and
slovenly. This is not the only occasion when the
Spaniards reported finding Indians of light complexions
and hair in California. One account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
speaks of a red-haired tribe not far north of San
Francisco, and still another of “white Indians”
at Monterey, but, judging by the light of our
subsequent knowledge of these aborigines, the
writers of these reports must have indulged in
exaggeration.</p>

<p>On the southern bank of the Santa Ana, not
far from the coast, is the town of the same name,
and further inland its waters have made to bloom
in the desert the famous orange orchards of
Riverside.</p>

<h3>SANTA MÓNICA</h3>

<p><i>Santa Mónica</i>, situated at the innermost point
of the great curve in the coast line just west of
Los Ángeles, was named in honor of a saintly
lady whose story is here quoted from Clara Erskine
Clement’s <i>Stories of the Saints</i>: “She was the
mother of St. Augustine, and was a Christian,
while his father was a heathen. Mónica was
sorely troubled at the dissipated life of her young
son; she wept and prayed for him, and at last
sought the advice and aid of the Bishop of Carthage,
who dismissed her with these words. ‘Go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
peace; the son of so many tears will not perish.’
At length she had the joy of beholding the baptism
of St. Augustine by the Bishop of Milan.”</p>

<p>Santa Mónica is venerated as the great patroness
of the Augustinian nuns, and might well
be placed at the head of the world-wide order of
“Anxious Mothers.”</p>

<h3>SANTA CATALINA</h3>

<p><i>Santa Catalina</i>, the beautiful island off the
coast of Southern California, was named by
Vizcaíno in honor of St. Catherine, because its
discovery occurred on the eve of her feast day,
November 24, 1602. In the diary of the voyage
we get an interesting description of the island and
its aboriginal inhabitants: “We continued our
journey along the coast until November 24, when,
on the eve of the glorious Santa Catalina, we discovered
three large islands; we took the one in the
middle, which is more than twenty-five leagues
in circumference, on November 27, and before
dropping anchor in a good cove which was found,
a great number of Indians came out in canoes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cedar-wood and pine, made of planking well-joined
and calked, and with eight oars each, and
fourteen or fifteen Indians, who looked like galley-slaves.
They drew near and came on board our
vessels without any fear whatever. We dropped
anchor and went on shore. There were on the
beach a great number of Indians, and the women
received us with roasted sardines and a fruit
cooked in the manner of sweet potatoes.”</p>

<p>Mass was celebrated there in the presence of
150 Indians. The people were very friendly and
the women led the white men by the hand into
their houses. The diary continues: “These
people go dressed in the skins of seals; the women
are modest but thievish. The Indians received
us with embraces and brought water in some very
well-made jars, and in others like flasks, that were
highly varnished on the outside. They have acorns
and some very large skins, with long wool, apparently
of bears, which serve them for blankets.”</p>

<p>The travelers found here an idol, “in the manner
of the devil, without a head, but with two horns,
a dog at the feet, and many children painted
around it.” The Indians readily gave up this
idol and accepted the cross in its stead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Catherine, patroness of this island, was one
of the most notable female martyrs of the Roman
Catholic church. We are told that she was of
royal blood, being the daughter of a half-brother
of Constantine the Great. She was converted to
Christianity, and became noted for her unusual
sanctity. She was both beautiful and intellectual,
and possessed the gift of eloquence in such a high
degree that she was able to confound fifty of the
most learned men appointed by Maximin to dispute
matters of religion with her. The same
Maximin, enraged by her refusal of his offers of
love, ordered that she be tortured “by wheels
flying in different directions, to tear her to pieces.
When they had bound her to these, an angel
came and consumed the wheels in fire, and the
fragments flew around and killed the executioners
and 3000 people. Maximin finally caused her to
be beheaded, when angels came and bore her
body to the top of Mt. Sinai. In the eighth century
a monastery was built over her burial place.”—(<i>Stories
of the Saints.</i>) Santa Catalina is the patroness
of education, science, philosophy, eloquence,
and of all colleges, and her island has good reason
to be satisfied with the name chosen by Vizcaíno.</p>

<h3>LAS ÁNIMAS BENDITAS</h3>

<p>Of <i>Las Ánimas</i> (the souls), which lay between
San Gabriel and the country of the Amajaba
(Mojave) Indians, we find the story in Fray
Joaquín Pasqual Nuez’s diary of the expedition
made in 1819 by Lieutenant Gabriel Moraga, to
punish the marauding Amajabas, who had murdered
a number of Christian natives. This name
was also used as the title of a land grant just
south of Gilroy.</p>

<p>The Moraga party arrived at a point “about a
league and a half from Our Lady of Guadalupe
of Guapiabit. We found the place where the
Amajabas killed four Christians of this mission
(San Gabriel), three from San Fernando, and some
<i>gentiles</i> (unbaptized Indians). We found the
skeletons and skulls roasted, and, at about a
gun-shot from there we pitched camp. The next
day, after mass, we caused the bones to be carried
in procession, the cross in front, Padre Nuez
chanting funeral services, to the spot where they
had been burned. There we erected a cross, at the
foot of which we caused the bones to be buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in a deep hole, and then we blessed the sepulchre.
We named the spot <i>Las Ánimas Benditas</i> (The
Blessed Souls).” May they rest in peace!</p>

<h3>SAN GABRIEL</h3>

<p><i>San Gabriel</i>, the quaint little town lying nine
miles east of Los Ángeles, is the site of the Mission
<i>San Gabriel Arcángel</i> (St. Gabriel Archangel),
founded September 8, 1771, by Padres Cambón
and Somera. This mission was placed in a fertile,
well-wooded spot, in the midst of a large Indian
population, who, under the instruction of the
padres, became experts in many arts, such as
sewing, weaving, soap-making, cobbling, etc.
Their flocks and herds increased to such an extent
that they covered the country for many miles
around.</p>

<p>The patron saint, San Gabriel, was the second
in rank of the archangels who stand before the
Lord. Whenever he is mentioned in the Bible,
it is as a messenger bearing important tidings,
and he is especially venerated as having carried
to the Virgin the message that she was to become
the mother of Christ.</p>

<h3>SAN FERNANDO</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the valley of <i>San Fernando</i> (St. Ferdinand),
a short distance northwest of Los Ángeles,
that the mission pertaining to the latter place was
established, September 8, 1797, by Padres Lasuén
and Dumetz. The Camulos Rancho, the home of
Ramona, the heroine of Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson’s
romance, was once included in the lands of
this mission.</p>

<p>St. Ferdinand, King of Spain, in whose honor
this place was named, was a notable warrior, as
well as a saint, and he succeeded in expelling the
Moors from Toledo, Córdova and Seville. He is
said also to have been a patron of the arts, and to
have been the founder of the cathedral at Burgos,
celebrated for the beauty of its architecture. But
more than for such attainments, he is remembered
for his tenderness toward the poor and lowly of
his people. When urged to put a tax upon them
in order to recruit his army, he replied: “God, in
whose cause I fight, will supply my need. I fear
more the curse of one poor old woman than a whole
army of Moors.”—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>)</p>

<h3>TEMESCAL</h3>

<p><i>Temescal</i> (sweathouse), in Riverside County,
although a place of no great importance in itself,
is interesting in that its name recalls one of the
curious customs widely prevalent among the
natives of the Southwest. The word itself is of
Aztec origin, and was brought to California by the
Franciscans.</p>

<p>The <i>temescal</i> is thus described by Dr. A. L.
Kroeber, in the University of California Publications
in Archaeology and Ethnology: “At the
Banning Reservation a sweathouse is still in use.
From the outside its appearance is that of a small
mound. The ground has been excavated to the
depth of a foot or a foot and a half, over a space
of about twelve by seven or eight feet. In the
center of this area two heavy posts are set up
three or four feet apart. These are connected at
the top by a log laid in their forks. Upon this
log, and in the two forks, are laid some fifty or
more logs and sticks of various dimensions, their
ends sloping down to the edge of the excavation.
It is probable that brush covers these timbers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The whole is thoroughly covered with earth.
There is no smoke hole. The entrance is on one
of the long sides, directly facing the space between
the two center posts, and only a few feet from
them. The fireplace is between the entrance and
the posts. It is just possible to stand upright in
the center of the house. In Northern California,
the so-called sweathouse is of larger dimensions,
and was preëminently a ceremonial or assembly
chamber.”</p>

<p>Dr. L. H. Bunnell, in his history of the discovery
of the Yosemite valley, gives us some interesting
details of the use of the sweathouse among
the Indians of that region: “The remains of these
structures were sometimes mistaken for <i>tumuli</i>,
being constructed of bark, reeds or grass, covered
with mud. It (the sweathouse), was used as a
curative for disease, and as a convenience for
cleansing the skin, when necessity demands it,
although the Indian race is not noted for cleanliness.
I have seen a half-dozen or more enter one
of these rudely constructed sweathouses through
the small aperture left for the purpose. Hot
stones are taken in, the aperture is closed until
suffocation would seem impending, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
would crawl out, reeking with perspiration, and
with a shout, spring like acrobats into the cold
waters of the stream. As a remedial agent for
disease, the same course is pursued, though varied
at times by the burning and inhalation of resinous
boughs and herbs. In the process of cleansing
the skin from impurities, hot air alone is generally
used. If an Indian had passed the usual period
of mourning for a relative, and the adhesive pitch
too tenaciously clung to his no longer sorrowful
countenance, he would enter and re-enter the
heated house until the cleansing had become
complete. The mourning pitch is composed of the
charred bones and ashes of the dead relative or
friend. These remains of the funeral pyre, with
the charcoal, are pulverized and mixed with the
resin of the pine; this hideous mixture is usually
retained upon the face of the mourner until it
wears off. If it has been well-compounded, it
may last nearly a year; although the young, either
from a super-abundance of vitality, excessive
reparative powers of the skin, or from powers of
will, seldom mourn so long. When the bare surface
exceeds that covered by the pitch, it is not a
scandalous disrespect in the young to remove it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
entirely, but a mother will seldom remove pitch
or garment until both are nearly worn out.”</p>

<p>This heroic treatment, while possibly efficacious
in the simple ailments by which the Indians were
most often afflicted, usually resulted in a great
increase of mortality in the epidemics of smallpox
following upon the footsteps of the white man.
One traveler speaks of a severe sort of intermittent
fever, to which the natives were subject,
and of which so many died that hundreds of bodies
were found strewn about the country. Having
observed that the whites, even when attacked by
this fever, rarely died of it, he was inclined to
ascribe the mortality among the natives to their
great cure-all, the <i>temescal</i>.</p>

<p>A number of places in the state bore this name,
among them a small town lying between the sites
now occupied by the flourishing cities of Oakland
and Berkeley. Its citizens became discontented
with the undignified character of the name, and
changed it to Alden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h3>SAN BERNARDINO</h3>

<p><i>San Bernardino</i> is the name of a county in the
southeastern part of California, whose broad
expanse is mainly made up of volcanic mountains,
desert plains, and valleys without timber or
water.</p>

<p>The name was first given to the snow-capped
peak, 11,600 feet high, lying about twenty miles
east of the city of San Bernardino, which is situated
sixty miles east of Los Ángeles, in the fruit
and alfalfa region. The name of this town is one
of the most regrettable examples of corruption
that have occurred in the state, having passed
from its original sweetly flowing syllables through
the successive stages of <i>San Berdino</i>, <i>Berdino</i>,
until finally reaching the acme of vulgarity as
<i>Berdoo</i>, by which appellation it is known to its
immediate neighbors. If ideas of romance, of
pleasant-sounding words, and of fidelity to history
make no appeal to our fellow-Californians, let
them read again the quotation from Stevenson
given above, and learn that a romantic nomenclature
may sometimes be a valuable financial asset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><i>San Bernardino</i> (St. Bernardinus), the patron
saint of the places bearing his name, is particularly
remembered as the founder of the charitable
institution known in Spanish as <i>Monte de Piedad</i>
(hill of pity), and in French as <i>Mont de Piété</i>,
municipal pawnshops where money was loaned
on pledges to the poor. These pawnshops are
still conducted in many Spanish towns, in America
as well as in Europe.</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Abalone Point</i>, some miles to the southeast of
San Pedro bay, was no doubt so-named from
the abundance of the great sea snails called
<i>abalone</i>, whose iridescent shells, the abandoned
dwellings of the dead animals, almost comparable
in beauty to the mother-of-pearl, once covered the
beaches of the California coast with a glittering
carpet. The word “once” is used advisedly, for,
with our usual easy-going American negligence
we have permitted these creatures of the sea,
valuable for their edible meat as well as for their
exquisitely colored shells, to be nearly destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by Chinese and Japanese fisheries. That the
flesh of the abalone formed a useful part of the
food supply of the Indians is evidenced by the
large number of shells to be found in the mounds
along the shore. In the living state the abalone
clings to the rocks on the shore, and its grip is
so tenacious that more than one unfortunate person,
caught by the foot or hand between the
shell and the rock, has been held there while
death crept slowly upon him in the shape of the
rising tide. There is another Abalone Point on
the northern coast.</p>

<p><i>Agua Caliente</i> (literally “hot water”), generally
used in reference to hot springs. Of these there
are many in the state, one on the Indian Reservation
southeast of Riverside. Agua Caliente
was originally a land grant.</p>

<p><i>Alamitos</i> (little cottonwoods), from <i>álamo</i>, a
tree of the poplar family indigenous to California.
There are several places bearing this name
in the state, one a short distance northeast of
Santa Ana.</p>

<p><i>Aliso</i> (alder tree), is the name of a place on
the Santa Fé Railroad, south of Los Ángeles,
near the shore, and was probably named for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the <i>Rancho Cañada de los Alisos</i>. It is probably
modern.</p>

<p><i>Azusa</i> is the name of a place in Los Ángeles
County, twenty miles east of Los Ángeles, and was
originally applied to the land grant there. It is
an Indian place name of a lodge, or ranchería, the
original form being <i>Asuksa-gna</i>, the <i>gna</i> an ending
which indicates place.</p>

<p><i>Bandini</i> (a surname), is the name of a place a
short distance southeast of Los Ángeles, on the
Santa Fé Railroad. The founder of this family
was José Bandini, a mariner of Spanish birth,
who came to California with war supplies, and
finally settled at San Diego. His son, Juan Bandini,
was a notable character in the history of the
state. He held several public offices, took part
in revolutions and colonization schemes, and finally
espoused the cause of the United States. Bancroft
gives the following resumé of his character:
“Juan Bandini must be regarded as one of the
most prominent men of his time in California.
He was a man of fair abilities and education, of
generous impulses, of jovial temperament, a most
interesting man socially, famous for his gentlemanly
manners, of good courage in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
personal misfortunes, and always well-liked and
respected; indeed his record as a citizen was an
excellent one. In his struggles against fate and
the stupidity of his compatriots he became
absurdly diplomatic and tricky as a politician.
He was an eloquent speaker and fluent writer.”
Members of the Bandini family still occupy
positions of respect and influence in the state and
have made some important additions to its historical
literature.</p>

<p><i>Bolsa</i> (pocket), a term much in use with the
Spaniards to signify a shut-in place. Bolsa is in
Orange County, twelve miles north by west of
Tres Pinos, and was probably named from the
land grant, <i>Rancho de las Bolsas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cabezón</i> (big head), is the name of a place southeast
of Colton. It was probably named for a
large-headed Indian chief who lived there at one
time and who received this name in pursuance of
an Indian custom of fitting names to physical
peculiarities. This name is improperly spelled
on some maps as Cabazon.</p>

<p><i>Cahuilla</i>, the name of an Indian tribe, probably
“Spanishized” in its spelling from Ka-we-a. The
valley and village of this name are situated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
San Jacinto Forest Reserve, southeast of Riverside,
and received their name from a tribe who
lived, in 1776, on the northern slopes of the San
Jacinto Mountains. The word <i>Cahuilla</i> is of
uncertain derivation.</p>

<p><i>Calabazas</i> (pumpkins), is northwest of Los
Ángeles. This is possibly a corruption of an
Indian word, <i>Calahuasa</i>, the name of a former
Chumash village near the mission of Santa Inez.
There is another possibility that this name may
have been given to the place by the Spaniards
in reference to the wild gourd which grows abundantly
there and whose fruit may have been considered
by them to bear some resemblance to
pumpkins, but this is of course mere conjecture.</p>

<p><i>Casa Blanca</i> (white house), is a short distance
west of Riverside, on the Santa Fé Railroad, so-called
from a large white ranch house once in
conspicuous view from the railroad station.</p>

<p><i>Casco</i> (skull), shell or outside part of anything.
El Casco is situated about twelve miles east of
Riverside. Its application here has not been
ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Conejo</i> (rabbit), is the name of a number of
places in the state, one of them in the Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Mónica Mountains, another in the Central Valley,
on the Santa Fé road.</p>

<p><i>Cucamonga</i>, is an Indian name, derived from a
village in San Bernardino County, forty-two miles
by rail east of Los Ángeles. It was originally
applied to the land grant at that place.</p>

<p><i>Duarte</i>, a surname.</p>

<p><i>Las Flores</i> (the flowers). At this place there was
once a large Indian village, called in the native
language <i>ushmai</i>, the place of roses, from <i>ushla</i>,
rose.</p>

<p><i>Garvanza</i> (chick-pea).</p>

<p><i>Hermosa</i> (beautiful), is the name of a town in
San Bernardino County, and of a beach in Los
Ángeles County.</p>

<p><i>Indio</i>, the Spanish word for “Indian,” is the
name of a place in Riverside County, near Colton.</p>

<p><i>La Joya</i> (the jewel).</p>

<p><i>Laguna</i> (lagoon).</p>

<p><i>León</i> (lion).</p>

<p><i>La Mirada</i> (the view).</p>

<p><i>Los Molinos</i> (the mills, or mill-stones), a name
applied to a place east of San Gabriel by the
Moraga party of 1819, who went out from the
mission on a punitive expedition against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Amajaba (Mojave) Indians. Padre Nuez, who
accompanied the party, says: “On the return we
passed by a place where there was plenty of water,
below a hill of red stone, very suitable for mill-stones.”
The same name, probably for similar
reasons, was applied to other places in the state,
among them one in Sonoma County, and Mill
Creek in Tehama County, originally called <i>El Río
de los Molinos</i> (The River of the Mill-stones).</p>

<p><i>Montalvo</i> (a surname), the name of a place in
Ventura County, near Ventura. This name is
interesting as being the same as that borne by the
author of <i>Las Sergas de Esplandián</i>, in which the
fabulous island of <i>California</i> plays a leading part.</p>

<p><i>Murietta</i> (a surname), the same as that of the
noted bandit, Joaquín Murietta, who once terrorized
California with his depredations. The
town of Murietta, however, was not named in
honor of this gentleman of unsavory memory,
but for Mr. J. Murietta, who is still living in
Southern California.</p>

<p><i>Los Nietos</i> (literally “the grandchildren”), but
in this case a surname, that of the Nieto family.
<i>Los Nietos</i> was a land grant taken up by Manuel
Nieto and José María Verdugo in 1784.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pasadena</i>, said to be derived from the Chippewa
Indian language. The full name is said to be
<i>Weoquan Pasadena</i>, and the meaning to be “Crown
of the Valley.” Let no man believe in the absurd
story that it means “Pass of Eden.”</p>

<p><i>Prado</i> (meadow). “The Prado” is also the name
of a famous promenade in the city of Madrid.</p>

<p><i>Puente</i> (bridge), in Los Ángeles County, was
taken from the name of the land grant, <i>Rancho
de la Puente</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pulgas Creek</i> (fleas creek).</p>

<p><i>Redondo Beach</i> (round beach), a well-known
seaside resort near Los Ángeles, is usually supposed
to have received its name from the curved
line of the shore there, but the fact that a land
grant occupying that identical spot was called
<i>Sausal Redondo</i> (round willow-grove), from a
clump of willows growing there accounts for
its name.</p>

<p><i>Rivera</i> (river, stream). Rivera was also the
name of a pioneer family.</p>

<p><i>Rodéo de las Aguas</i> (gathering of the waters),
a name once given to the present site of La Brea
Rancho, near Los Ángeles, perhaps because there
is at that point a natural amphitheatre which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
receives the greater portion of the waters flowing
from the neighboring mountains and the Cahuenga
Pass.</p>

<p><i>San Clemente</i> (St. Clement), the name of the
island fifteen miles south of Santa Catalina. The
saint for whom this island was named “was condemned
to be cast into the sea bound to an anchor.
But when the Christians prayed, the waters were
driven back for three miles, and they saw a ruined
temple which the sea had covered, and in it was
found the body of the saint, with the anchor
round his neck. For many years, at the anniversary
of his death, the sea retreated for seven
days, and pilgrimages were made to this submarine
tomb.”—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>)</p>

<p><i>San Jacinto</i> (St. Hyacinth), was a Silesian
nobleman who became a monk, and was noted
for his intellectual superiority, as well as for his
piety. San Jacinto is the name of a town in Riverside
County, thirty miles southeast of Riverside,
in the fruit region, and of the range of mountains
in the same county.</p>

<p><i>San Juan Point</i> (St. John Point).</p>

<p><i>San Matéo Point</i> (St. Matthew Point).</p>

<p><i>San Onofre</i> (St. Onophrius), was a hermit saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
whose chief claim to sanctity seems to have been
that he deprived himself of all the comforts of
life and lived for sixty years in the desert, “during
which time he never uttered a word except in
prayer, nor saw a human face.”</p>

<p><i>San Pedro</i> (St. Peter), is on San Pedro bay,
twenty-six miles south of Los Ángeles. St. Peter,
the fisherman apostle and companion of St. Paul,
is usually represented as the custodian of the keys
of Heaven and Hell, one key being of gold and the
other of iron. “There is a legend that the Gentiles
shaved his head in mockery, and that from this
originated the tonsure of the priests.” Peter
suffered martyrdom by crucifixion, “but traditions
disagree in regard to the place where he
suffered.” The name Peter is said to signify “a
rock.” “Thou art Peter, on this rock have I
founded My church.”—(Matthew, 16, 18.)</p>

<p><i>Saticoy</i> was the name of a former Chumash
Indian village on the lower part of Santa Paula
River, in Ventura County, about eight miles from
the sea. The present town of Saticoy is on the Santa
Clara River, in Ventura County, near Ventura.</p>

<p><i>Serra</i> (a surname), probably given in honor of
the celebrated founder of the California missions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>El Toro</i> (the bull).</p>

<p><i>Trabuco Canyon</i> (literally blunderbuss canyon),
from <i>trabuco</i>, a short, wide-mouthed gun formerly
used by the Spaniards, although this may not be
the true derivation of the name in this case. One
writer has translated this name as “land much
tumbled about,” but where he obtained such a
meaning remains an impenetrable mystery. Trabuco
may be a surname here.</p>

<p><i>Valle Verde</i> (green valley), incorrectly spelled
on the map as <i>Val Verde</i>.</p>

<p><i>Valle Vista</i> (valley view), is in Riverside County,
five miles northwest of San Jacinto. This name
is modern and incorrect in construction.</p>

<p><i>Verdugo</i> was named for the Verdugo family,
the owners of the <i>Rancho San Rafael</i>, northeast
of Los Ángeles and near the base of the Verdugo
mountains. José María Verdugo was one of the
grantees of the Nietos grant in 1784.</p>

<p><i>Vicente Point</i> (Point Vincent). This point was
named in 1793 by George Vancouver, the English
explorer, in honor of Friar Vicente Santa María,
“one of the reverend fathers of the mission of
Buena Ventura.”</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE VICINITY OF SANTA BÁRBARA</span></h2>

<p><i>Santa Bárbara</i>, the charming little town that
dreams away its existence among the flowers of
its old gardens, on the shore of the sheltered
stretch of water formed by the islands lying to the
seaward, was named for a noble lady of Heliopolis,
the daughter of Dioscorus. She became converted
to Christianity, and was in consequence
cruelly persecuted and finally beheaded by her
own father. “The legend that her father was
struck by lightning in punishment for this crime
probably caused her to be regarded by the common
people as the guardian saint against tempest
and fire, and later, by analogy, as the protectress
of artillery-men and miners.” (Catholic Encyclopedia.)
For this reason her image was placed
over the doors of powder magazines, and her
name came at last to be applied to the magazines
themselves, which are known to the Spanish
people as <i>santabárbaras</i>. Thus is explained the
apparent incongruity between the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
gentle saint and the places for storage of the
instruments of savage war.</p>

<p>At the time of the arrival of the Spaniards the
shores of the Santa Bárbara channel probably
supported a denser native population than any
other part of the state. The gracious climate and
never-failing food supply furnished by the generous
waters of the ocean, enabled the Indians
to live at ease.</p>

<p>When Cabrillo entered the channel in 1542, he
reported that: “A great number of Indians issued
from the bushes, yelling and dancing, and making
signs, inviting us to come on shore. They laid
down their bows and arrows and came to the
vessel in a good canoe. They possessed boats,
large enough to carry twelve or fourteen men,
well-constructed of bent planks and cemented

<p>These Indians were of a higher order of intelligence
than those further north, and were skilled
in some of the arts, including the making of
excellent pottery. They were expert fishermen,
using nets for the purpose, and often eating the
fish raw. They wore their hair long, tied up with
long cords, to which many small daggers of flint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wood and bone were attached. They had some
notion of music, using a primitive sort of flute,
or whistle, made of the hollow bones of birds.
They lived in conical houses, which were covered
well down to the ground.</p>

<p>When Father Serra passed that way, more than
two centuries later, he found the same conditions
of population, counting as many as twenty
populous villages along the channel. He was
moved to bitter tears of grief over the delay
in establishing a mission where so rich a harvest
of souls lay ready to his hand. He died before
this dearest wish of his heart was accomplished,
yet Santa Bárbara may justly claim the honor
of his presence at her birth, for he took part in
the establishment of the presidio, which occurred
in 1783, three years before the building of the
mission. In Palou’s <i>Life of Serra</i> he describes that
occasion thus: “The party traveled along the
coast of the channel, in sight of the islands which
form it, and when they judged it to be about
half-way, about nine leagues from San Buenaventura,
they stopped and selected a site for the presidio,
in sight of the beach, which there forms a
sort of bay, furnishing anchorage for ships. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
this beach there was a large village of <i>Gentiles</i>.
Here the cross was raised, Father Serra blessed
it and the land, and held mass. The following
day they began to cut wood for the building of
the chapel, the priest’s house, officials’ houses,
cuartel, <i>almacenes</i> (storehouses), houses for families
of married soldiers and the stockade.”</p>

<p>The mission, which is still in an excellent state of
preservation, was not established until December
4, 1786, although Serra looked upon that location
as the most desirable in California, and spent the
last years of his life in constant efforts to urge
on the authorities to the work. That his hopes
were realized to the full after his death, and that
large numbers of natives, as well as the succeeding
white parishioners, knelt before the altar dedicated
to the gentle Santa Bárbara, is evidenced by the
deeply worn marks of several generations of feet
to be seen in the wide flight of steps at the entrance.</p>

<p>A circumstance that makes Santa Bárbara
unique among the missions is that within her
gardens, hidden behind their secluding walls,
there is a “holy of holies” where no woman’s
foot is permitted to desecrate the sacred ground.
It is quite likely that this rule is kept up by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
brothers now in charge of the mission, rather
through a desire to preserve the traditions of the
old church than through any unwarranted prejudice
against the fair sex.</p>

<h3>SAN BUENAVENTURA</h3>

<p><i>San Buenaventura Mission</i>, at the town now
called Ventura, stands near the southeastern end
of the Santa Bárbara channel. It was the last
work of the great Serra, and was founded March
31, 1782, by the venerable president himself and
Father Cambón. Palou gives us a detailed account
of this event in his <i>Life of Serra</i>: “March 26, the
whole party, the largest ever engaged in the
founding of a mission, soldiers, settlers, and their
families, muleteers, etc., but only two priests,
Padres Serra and Cambón, set out....
They went on to the head of the channel, a site
near the beach, on whose edge there was a large
town of <i>Gentiles</i>, (unbaptized Indians), well built
of pyramidal houses made of straw. They raised
the cross, erected an arbor to serve as chapel, made
an altar and adorned it. On the last day of March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they took possession and held the first mass. The
natives assisted willingly in building the chapel,
and continued friendly, helping to build a house
for the padre,—all of wood. The soldiers began
to cut timbers for their houses, and for the stockade.
They also went to work at once to conduct
water by ditches from a neighboring stream, to
bring it conveniently near the houses, and to
serve to irrigate crops. By means of a neophyte,
brought from San Gabriel, they were able to communicate
with the natives, and to let them know
that their only purpose in coming here was to
direct their souls to Heaven.”</p>

<p>The patron of this mission was originally named
Giovanni Fidanga. When a child he fell very ill,
and was taken by his mother to St. Francis to be
healed. When the saint saw him recovered he
exclaimed: “O buena ventura!” whereupon his
mother dedicated him to God by the name of
<i>Buenaventura</i> (good fortune). It is a pity that a
name of such happy augury should be mutilated
by the amputation of its first part, the town and
county now appearing as <i>Ventura</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h3>ASUNCIÓN</h3>

<p>In the diaries of the Spanish pioneers, a distinct
impression is conveyed that the California Indians,
so far from being morose and taciturn, as their
brothers in other parts of the United States are
often portrayed, were rather a merry lot, and
received the white men everywhere in their long
journey up the coast, with music, feasting and the
dance. In fact, we run across a complaint now
and then that their hospitality was sometimes so
insistent that their guests suffered from loss of
sleep, the serenading being kept up during the
entire night.</p>

<p>Their music, no doubt of the most primitive
sort, was produced by means of “a small whistle,
sometimes double, sometimes single, about the
size and length of a common fife. It was held in
the mouth by one end, without the aid of the
fingers, and only about two notes could be sounded
on it.”—(Bancroft, from Cal. Farmer.)</p>

<p>Along the Santa Bárbara channel the festivities
in honor of the strangers were especially lively.
At <i>Asunción</i> (Ascension), a point on the coast five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
leagues below Carpintería, they received a reception
of which we read in Costansó’s diary of the
Portolá expedition of 1769, date of August 14:
“We reached the coast, and came in sight of a
real town, situated on a tongue or point of land,
right on the shore, which it dominated, seeming
to command the waters. We counted as many as
thirty large and capacious houses, spherical in
form, well built and thatched with grass. We
judged there could not be less than four hundred
souls in the town. These natives are well built
and of a good disposition, very agile and alert, diligent
and skillful. Their handiness and ability were
at their best in the construction of their canoes,
made of good pine boards, well joined and calked,
and of a pleasing form. They handle these with
equal skill, and three or four men go out to sea in
them to fish, for they will hold eight or ten men.
They use long, double-bladed paddles, and row
with indescribable agility and swiftness. All their
work is neat and well finished, and what is most
worthy of surprise is that to work the wood and
stone they have no other tools than those made of
flint.... We saw, and obtained in
exchange for strings of glass beads, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
trinkets, some baskets or trays made of reeds,
with different designs; wooden plates, and bowls
of different forms and sizes, made of one piece,
so that not even those turned out in a lathe could
be more successful. They presented us with a
quantity of fish, particularly the kind known as
<i>bonito</i>; it had as good a flavor as that caught in the
tunny-fisheries of Cartegena de Levante, and on
the coasts of Granada. We gave it the name of
<i>La Asunción de Nuestra Señora</i> (the Ascension of
Our Lady), because we reached it on the eve of
that festival.”—(Translation edited by Frederick
T. Teggart.)</p>

<h3>EL BAILARÍN</h3>

<p><i>El Bailarín</i> (the dancer). This spot, one league
from Carpintería, was named in honor of a nimble-footed
Indian, who cheered the weary travelers
on their way, as thus told by Father Crespi, in
his diary of the Portolá expedition: “This place
was named through the notable fact of an Indian
having feasted us extraordinarily two leagues
beyond (always coasting the sea-shore), where
there is a large town on a point of land on the
same shore; which Indian was a robust man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
good form, and a great dancer; through respect
for him we called this town, of which our friend
was a resident, <i>El Pueblo del Bailarín</i> (the Town
of the Dancer).”</p>

<p><i>Ranchería del Baile de las Indias</i> (Village of the
Dance of the Indian Women). As a rule, the
women seemed to take no part in the dances, but
Costansó tells of one occasion when they joined
in the festivities: “They honored us with a
dance, and it was the first place where we saw the
women dance. Two of these excelled the others;
they had a bunch of flowers in their hands, and
accompanied the dance with various graceful
gestures and movements, without getting out of
time in their songs. We called the place the
<i>Ranchería del Baile de las Indias</i>.”</p>

<p>This place was about five leagues from Point
Pedernales.</p>

<h3>CARPINTERÍA</h3>

<p><i>Carpintería</i> is the name of a little cluster of
houses near the shore about ten miles east of
Santa Bárbara. It lies in a region once densely
populated with natives of very “gentle and mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
disposition.” The story of its naming is told by
Father Crespi, of the Portolá party: “Not very
far from the town we saw some springs of
asphaltum. These Indians have many canoes,
and at that time were constructing one, for which
reason the soldiers named this town Carpintería
(carpenter shop), but I baptized it with the name
of <i>San Roque</i>.”</p>

<h3>MONTECITO</h3>

<p><i>Montecito</i> (little hill or little wood), is the name
of a small village about six miles from Santa
Bárbara. The country in this vicinity, through
its extraordinary charm of climate and scenery,
has attracted a large number of very rich people,
whose splendid country houses, in bizarre contrast,
now occupy the self-same spots where the
Indians once raised their flimsy huts of straw.</p>

<h3>SANTA CRUZ ISLAND</h3>

<p>While traversing the shore of Santa Bárbara
channel, the Portolá expedition of 1769 took time
to make trips to the islands and bestow names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
upon them. The island of Santa Cruz received
its name from a rather trivial circumstance. By
some chance the padres lost there a staff which
bore a cross on the end. They gave it up as
irretrievably lost, so were the more pleased when
the Indians appeared the following day to restore
it. From this they gave the island the name of
<i>Santa Cruz</i> (Holy Cross).</p>

<h3>RANCHERÍA DE LA ESPADA</h3>

<p>Of the <i>Ranchería de la Espada</i> (village of the
sword), Captain Fages, of the Portolá expedition
says: “Two and a half leagues northwest of Point
Conception, another glen is found with a population
of twenty hearths, with 250 Indians, more or
less. The natives of the settlement here are
extremely poor and starved, so that they can
scarcely live, being without canoes, in rugged
land, and short of firewood. While here a soldier
lost his sword, leaving it carelessly fastened, so
that they took it from his belt. But the Indians
who saw this theft themselves ran in pursuit of
the thief, and deprived him of the article in order
that its owner might recover it.” From this the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
place received the name of the <i>Ranchería de la
Espada</i>, and the little story is still commemorated
in the name of Espada Landing.</p>

<h3>MATILIJA</h3>

<p><i>Matilija Creek</i> and <i>Matilija Springs</i>, in Ventura
County, derive their name from an Indian village,
one of those mentioned in the mission archives.
The name is best known as applied to the Matilija
poppy, that flower of the gods which has its native
habitat along the banks of the creek. This giant
poppy, by reason of its extraordinary size and
delicate beauty, has a just claim to be called
“queen of all California’s wild flowers,” as the
Sequoia is king of her trees. It is a perennial
plant, of shrubby character, and grows wild in
the southern part of the state, from the Santa
María River southward, extending into Lower
California, where it spreads over large areas. It
flourishes in particular luxuriance in the Matilija
canyon, but the popular idea that that spot was
its only habitat is erroneous. The shrub reaches
a height of eight or ten feet, has gray-green foliage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and bears splendid, six-petaled white flowers,
often six or seven inches in diameter, “of a crepe-like
texture, pure glistening white, with bright
yellow centers.” “It not only grows in fertile
valleys, but seeks the seclusion of remote canyons,
and nothing more magnificent could be imagined
than a steep canyon-side covered with the great
bushy plants, thickly covered with the enormous
white flowers.”—(Miss Parsons, quoted by J.
Burt Davy, in <i>Bailey’s Cyclopedia of American
Horticulture</i>.)</p>

<h3>POINT PEDERNALES</h3>

<p>Captain Fages, of the Portolá party, says of
this place: “Going two leagues through high
land, and with a good outlook over the sea-coast,
a flowing stream appears, with very good water,
and near it a poor settlement of only ten houses,
probably numbering about sixty inhabitants,
crowded together. We stopped at the place near
where a strip or point of land extends to the sea.
There we gathered a multitude of flints, good for
fire-arms, and so this place is called <i>Los Pedernales</i>
(the flints).”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Point Pedernales still remains as the name of
“that point of land extending into the sea,” a few
miles north of Point Conception.</p>

<h3>CAMULOS</h3>

<p><i>Camulos</i>, also spelled <i>Kamulas</i>, was the name
of an Indian village near San Buenaventura.
This village is among those mentioned in the
mission archives, and is noted as the home of
Ramona, the heroine of Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson’s
romance. The meaning of the word <i>Camulos</i>,
according to Professor A. L. Kroeber, is “my fruit.”</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Los Álamos</i> (the cottonwoods), is in Santa
Bárbara County, northwest of Santa Bárbara.
The <i>álamo</i> is a species of poplar tree indigenous
to California and widely spread throughout the
state.</p>

<p><i>Argüello Point</i> is on the coast of Santa Bárbara
County, just south of Point Pedernales. Argüello
is a surname, that of a pioneer family, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
José Darío Argüello was the founder. “For
many years Don José was the most prominent,
influential and respected man in California.”—(Bancroft.)</p>

<p><i>Argüello Point</i> was named by Vancouver in
honor of the Spanish governor.—(Mr. Charles
B. Turrill.)</p>

<p><i>El Cojo</i> (the lame one). This place, near Point
Conception, was so-named by the Spaniards
because they saw here an Indian chief who was
lame.</p>

<p><i>Point Concepción</i>, the point at the southwestern
extremity of Santa Bárbara County, was so-named
in reference to the “immaculate conception” of
the Virgin.</p>

<p><i>Los Dos Pueblos</i> (the two towns), is on the coast
a few miles west of Santa Bárbara. On October
16, 1542, the Cabrillo expedition anchored opposite
two Indian villages here, and named the place
<i>Los Dos Pueblos</i>. “Although these villages were
separated only by a small stream, their inhabitants
were of a different race and language, those
on one side being short, thick and swarthy, and
on the other tall, slender and not so dark. The
depth of the kitchen refuse at the site of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
two towns indicates that these Indians had lived
here since the Christian era and were contemporary
with the mound builders.”—(<i>History of
Santa Bárbara County.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gaviota</i> (sea-gull), is on the shore a few miles
west of Santa Bárbara. Father Crespi mentions
having given this name to another place further
down the coast: “We reached an estuary, on
whose border stood a ranchería of fifty-two huts,
with three hundred people. For having killed a
sea-gull here, the soldiers called this place <i>La Gaviota</i>,
but I named it <i>San Luís Rey de Francia</i>.”
As <i>San Luís Rey</i> it has remained upon the map.</p>

<p><i>Gaviota Pass</i> is an important gap in the Santa
Inez range.</p>

<p>Every one who has crossed the bay of San
Francisco in the winter season must have rejoiced
in the sight of the flying convoy of those beautiful
creatures, the <i>gaviotas</i>, by which each ferry-boat
is accompanied.</p>

<p><i>Goleta</i> (schooner), is the name of a village in
Santa Bárbara County, seven miles west of Santa
Bárbara.</p>

<p><i>Guadalupe</i> (a Christian name). The town is
near the northern border of Santa Bárbara County.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lompoc</i> is one of the names of Indian villages
taken from the mission archives. It is situated
fifty miles northwest of Santa Bárbara, on the
Southern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p><i>Nojoqui</i>, in Santa Bárbara County, was presumably
the name of an Indian village.</p>

<p><i>Los Olivos</i> (the olives), is in Santa Bárbara
County, on the Coast Line Railroad.</p>

<p><i>La Piedra Pintada</i> (the painted rock), is about
eighty miles from Santa Bárbara. Here there was
a stone wigwam, forty or fifty yards in diameter,
whose walls were covered with paintings in the
form of halos and circles, with radiations from the
center.—(<i>History of Santa Bárbara County.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Punta Gorda</i> (fat or broad point), is one of the
points of land running into the sea from the Santa
Bárbara Coast. Its name indicates its shape.</p>

<p><i>Punta de las Ritas</i> (point of the rites), perhaps
refers to some religious ceremony held upon that
spot.</p>

<p><i>Rincón Point</i> (corner point), is one of the many
points of land running out from the Santa Bárbara
Coast.</p>

<p><i>Point Sal</i>, was named for Hermenegi do Sal,
who was one of the prominent figures in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
history of Southern California. He was a Spanish
soldier who came to this coast in 1776 with Anza
and his party of colonists. Sal filled many important
military offices. This point was named by
Vancouver for this official, who was at one time
commandante of the presidio of San Francisco,
in return for signal courtesies shown by him in
1792, when he permitted Vancouver to go to the
mission of Santa Clara, this being the first occasion
when this part of Spanish America was penetrated
by any foreigner.</p>

<p><i>Sal Si Puedes</i> (get out if you can). Several
places in the state, one in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
another in Santa Bárbara County, received
this name, so eloquent of the rough road that the
Spaniards sometimes had to travel. Captain
Argüello, in his diary of the expedition of 1821,
refers to his struggles in getting out of a certain
canyon in these terms: “On account of its difficult
situation it was named <i>Montaña de Maltrato
y Arroyo de Sal si Puedes</i>” (mountain of ill-treatment
and creek of get out if you can).</p>

<p><i>Santa Inez</i> (St. Agnes), is the name of a river
in Santa Bárbara County which rises in the coast
range and falls into the Pacific Ocean about ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
miles north of Cape Conception. The town of
the same name is situated on this river. The
Mission Santa Inez was founded September 17,
1804, by Padres Tapis, Calzada and Gutierrez.
It flourished for a time, but was greatly damaged
by an earthquake in 1812, was rebuilt and damaged
again by the Indians in the revolt of 1824, and its
partially ruined buildings still remain to tell of a
vanished past. Its patroness, St. Agnes, was one
of the four great virgin martyrs of the Latin
Church. She was a Roman maiden of great
beauty, and was condemned to death by the sword,
by the Prefect Sempronius, in revenge for her
refusal to marry his son, on the ground that she
was “already affianced to a husband whom she
loved, meaning Jesus.” Before causing her death
Sempronius attempted to procure her dishonor
by having her conveyed to a house of infamy,
“but when she prayed to Christ that she might
not be dishonored, she saw before her a shining
white garment which she put on with joy, and the
room was filled with great light.”</p>

<p><i>Santa María</i> (St. Mary), so-named in honor of
the mother of Christ, is in Santa Bárbara County,
near the Santa María River.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SAN LUÍS OBISPO GROUP</span></h2>

<p><i>San Luís Obispo</i> (St. Louis the Bishop). Travelers
on the Coast Line, whose attention is attracted
to the smiling vale where the pretty town
of <i>San Luís Obispo</i> nestles in the hollow of the
hills, about eight miles from the ocean and ninety
to the northwest of Santa Bárbara, will doubtless
be pleased to learn something of its history. So
peaceful is the aspect of the valley at this time
that it comes rather as a surprise to read, in the
diaries of the Portolá expedition of 1769, stories
of fierce fights with bears, which then haunted
this place in such numbers that the explorers gave
it the name of <i>La Cañada de los Osos</i> (the glen of
the bears). From Father Crespi we get some
account of the numbers and ferocity of these
animals: “In this glen we saw troops of bears,
which have the ground ploughed up and full of
scratches which they make in search of the roots
that form their food. Upon these roots, of which
there are many of a good savor and taste, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<i>Gentiles</i> (unbaptized Indians), also live. The
soldiers, who went out to hunt, succeeded in killing
one bear with gun-shots, and experienced the
ferocity of these animals. Upon feeling themselves
wounded they attack the hunter at full
speed, and he can only escape by using the greatest
dexterity. They do not yield except when the
shot succeeds in reaching the head or heart. The
one that the soldiers killed received nine balls
before falling, and did not fall until one struck
him in the head.”</p>

<p>Captain Fages, of the same expedition, gives a
similar account “....a spacious glen
with a rivulet of very good water....
In said glen they saw whole herds of bears, which
have ploughed up all the ground, where they dug
to seek their livelihood from the roots that it
produces. They are ferocious brutes, and of very
difficult hunting, throwing themselves with incredible
speed and anger upon the hunter, who
only escapes by means of a swift horse. They do
not yield to the shot unless it be in the head or
heart.”</p>

<p>Miguel Costansó, of the same party, says:
“In the afternoon, as they had seen many tracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of bears, six soldiers went out hunting on horseback,
and succeeded in shooting one bear. It
was an enormous animal; it measured fourteen
palms from the sole of the feet to the top of its
head; its feet were more than a foot long; and it
must have weighed over 375 pounds. We ate
the flesh and found it savory and good.”—(Translation
edited by Frederick J. Teggart.)</p>

<p>At a later date, when the mission at Monterey
was in serious danger of a famine, Captain Fages
called to mind the experiences in the <i>Cañada de
los Osos</i>, and headed a hunting expedition to that
region for the purpose of securing a supply of
bear meat. The party succeeded in killing a
considerable number of the animals, and were
thus able to relieve the scarcity at Monterey.
The name of <i>Los Osos</i> (the bears), is still applied
to a valley in the vicinity of San Luís Obispo.</p>

<p>Finding this spot highly suitable for a settlement,
in the matters of climate, arable land and
water, points always carefully considered by the
padres, the mission of <i>San Luís Obispo de Tolosa</i>
(St. Louis the Bishop of Toulouse), was established
by Padre Serra, September 1, 1772, in <i>La
Cañada de los Osos</i>. In the usual course of events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the name of the mission was extended to the town
and finally to the county.</p>

<p>The story of the patron saint of this mission
runs as follows: “St. Louis of Toulouse was the
nephew of St. Louis King of France, and son of
the King of Naples and Sicily. Like his kingly
uncle-saint, he was piously reared by his mother.
When he was but fourteen, his father, being made
prisoner by the King of Aragón, gave Louis and
his brother as hostages. He became wearied of
everything but religion, and in 1294, when he
was made free, he gave all his royal rights to his
brother Robert, and became a monk of the Order
of St. Francis. He was then twenty-two years
old. Soon he was made Bishop of Toulouse;
and he set out, bare-footed and clothed as a friar,
to take his new office. He went into Provence
on a charitable mission, and died at the castle
of Brignolles, where he was born. He was first
buried at Marseilles, then removed to Valencia,
where he was enshrined. His pictures represent
him as young, beardless, and of gentle face.
He has the fleur-de-lys embroidered on his
cope, or on some part of his dress. The crown
which he gave away lies at his feet, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wears the mitre of a bishop.”—(<i>Stories of the
Saints.</i>)</p>

<h3>SAN MIGUEL</h3>

<p><i>San Miguel</i> (St. Michael), situated about forty-seven
miles northeast of San Luís Obispo, is the
site of Mission San Miguel, founded July 25,
1797, by Padres Lasuén and Sitjar. It is said that
“the lands of this mission extended from the
Tulares on the east to the sea on the west, and
from the north boundary of the San Luís Obispo
district to the south line of San Antonio. It had
its work-shops and little factories where the good
padres taught the Indians the useful arts. Its
property was confiscated in 1836, and sold at
auction in 1846.”</p>

<p>St. Michael, in whose honor this mission was
named, “is regarded as the first and mightiest
of all created spirits. He it was whom God commissioned
to expel Satan and the rebellious angels
from Heaven. His office now is believed to be
two-fold, including that of patron saint of the
Church on earth, and Lord of the souls of the
dead; presenting the good to God and sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the evil and wicked away to torment.” In pictures
St. Michael is always represented as young
and beautiful, sometimes as the Lord of souls in
pictures of death, sometimes in armor as the
conqueror of Satan.</p>

<h3>PASO DE ROBLES</h3>

<p><i>Paso de Robles</i> (pass of the oaks), known far
and wide for its hot sulphur springs, where the
sick of many lands find surcease from their pain,
is situated twenty-nine miles north of San Luís
Obispo. It was named for the reason indicated
by Father Crespi, who says: “....in
a valley in the hollow of the Santa Lucía Mountains,
called <i>Los Robles</i>, for the great abundance
of these trees with which it is populated.”</p>

<p>It should be explained that the <i>roble</i> is not the
evergreen, or live-oak, which is called <i>encino</i>. At
Leland Stanford Jr. University the names of these
two species of oaks have been rather poetically
used for the students’ dormitories,—Encina Hall
for the men, and Roble Hall for the women.</p>

<p><i>Arroyo Grande</i> (big creek), a village in San Luís
Obispo County, fifteen miles southeast of San
Luís Obispo.</p>

<p><i>Atascadero</i> (boggy ground, quagmire).</p>

<p><i>Avenal</i> (a field sown with oats).</p>

<p><i>Buchón</i> (big craw), is the name of the point
on the coast directly opposite the town of San
Luís Obispo, and has a significance not altogether
agreeable. The Spanish soldiers called the place
<i>Buchón</i> from an Indian in the neighborhood who
was the unfortunate possessor of an enormous
goitre, which was so large that it hung down upon
his breast.</p>

<p><i>Cañada del Osito</i> (glen of the little bear), so-called
because some Indians from the mountains
offered the Spaniards a present of a bear cub.</p>

<p><i>Cayucos</i> is the name of a village in San Luís
Obispo County, eighteen miles northwest of San
Luís Obispo. The word <i>cayuco</i> is probably Indian
in origin, and is used in different senses in different
parts of America. In Venezuela it means a small
fishing boat, built to hold only one person, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in Cuba it means “head.” As this place is on the
shore, it was probably named in reference to
Indian fishing skiffs.</p>

<p><i>Cholame</i> (the name of an Indian tribe).</p>

<p><i>Cuesta</i> (hill, mount, ridge, also family name).</p>

<p><i>Esteros</i> (estuaries, creeks into which the tide
flows at flood time).</p>

<p><i>Estero Point</i> (estuary point).</p>

<p><i>Estrella</i> (star).</p>

<p><i>López</i> (a surname).</p>

<p><i>Morro</i> (headland, bluff). Morro is the name of
a hamlet in San Luís Obispo County, on the
shore, twelve miles northwest of San Luís Obispo.</p>

<p><i>Nacimiento</i> (birth). This word is generally
used by the Spaniards in the sense of the birth
of Christ.</p>

<p><i>Los Osos</i> (the bears).</p>

<p><i>Piedras Blancas</i> (white stones, or rocks), the
name of a point on the coast.</p>

<p><i>Pismo</i>, an Indian word said to mean “place of
fish”, but this definition is not based upon
scientific authority.</p>

<p><i>Pozo</i> (well, or pool), is the name of a village in
San Luís Obispo County.</p>

<p><i>San Simeón</i> (St. Simeon), is the name of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
village in San Luís Obispo County, on the shore
twenty miles south of Jolón. It has a good harbor.
St. Simeon, the patron saint of this place, was one
of the apostles, and is called “the Prophet”
because he was the translator of the book of
Isaiah in which is made the prophecy “Behold a
virgin shall conceive.”</p>

<p>St. Simeon Stylites, who set the fashion of the
pillar-hermits, spent almost half of the fifth
century on the summit of a column sixty feet in
height, drawing up his meager food and water
in a pail which he lowered for the purpose. This
peculiar and apparently senseless mode of life
has been partially justified by the reflection that
the notoriety he thus gained brought curious
crowds of pagans about his pillar, to whom he
was enabled to preach the Christian doctrine.
It is said that he converted many thousands of the
nomadic Saracen tribes to Christianity.</p>

<p><i>Santa Lucía</i> (St. Lucy), is the name of a section
of the coast range of mountains in the central
part of the state. St. Lucy is the protectress
against all diseases of the eye, and is the patroness
of the laboring poor.</p>

<p><i>Santa Margarita</i> (St. Margaret), is the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a town in San Luís Obispo County, on the Southern
Pacific Railroad. St. Margaret is the patroness
who presides over births.</p>

<p><i>Monterey</i>. “<i>Llegamos á este puerto de Monterey
á 16 de Diciembre, 1602 á las siete de la noche</i>”
(We arrived at this port of Monterey on the sixteenth
of December, 1602, at seven o’clock in the
evening).—(From the diary of Sebastián Vizcaíno.)</p>

<p>When Vizcaíno sailed into the beautiful blue
bay of Monterey, and looked about him at the
ring of hills, dark with the dense growth of pines
covering them from summit to base, he became
at once enamored with the place, and wrote
enthusiastically to his Spanish Majesty concerning
it. In a letter of the date of May 23, 1603,
he says: “Among the ports of most importance
which I found was one in latitude 37, which I
named Monterrey. As I wrote to your majesty
from there on the twenty-eighth of September
of the said year, it is all that can be desired for
the convenience and sea-port of the ships of the
Philippine line, whence they come to explore this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
coast. The port is sheltered from all winds, and
has on the shore many pines to supply the ships
with masts of any size that they may wish, and
also live-oaks, oaks, rosemary, rock-roses, roses
of Alexandria, good hunting of rabbits, hares,
partridges and flying birds of different sorts.
The land is of mild temperature, and of good
waters, and very fertile, judging by the luxuriant
growth of the trees and plants, for I saw some
fruits from them, particularly of chestnuts and
acorns, larger than those of Spain; and it is well-populated
with people, whose disposition I saw
to be soft, gentle, docile, and very fit to be reduced
to the Holy Church. Their food is of many and
various seeds that they have and also wild game,
such as deer, some of which are larger than cows,
also bears, and cattle and buffalo, and many
others. The Indians are of good body, white of
countenance, and the women somewhat smaller,
and well-favored. Their dress is of the people
of the beach, of the skins of seals, of which there
are an abundance, which they tan and prepare
better than in Spain.”</p>

<p class="caption">“We arrived at this port of Monterey on the sixteenth of December, 1602, at seven o’clock in the
evening.”—(Sebastián Vizcaíno)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>At first thought it would seem that Vizcaíno
must have been in error about finding buffalo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at Monterey, but investigation shows that in
1530 those animals “ranged through what is now
New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and
British Columbia.”—(<i>Handbook of American
Indians.</i>) Oregon is not so far away but that
scattering herds may have wandered as far as
Monterey, and that Vizcaíno actually saw them
there. It has been suggested, also, that he may
have mistaken the tracks of the great elk for
those of buffalo. In calling the Indians “white,”
he was, no doubt, speaking comparatively. According
to the diaries of the Spaniards, the natives
of different sections varied considerably in complexion.
What he meant by “chestnuts” can
only be conjectured, since that tree is not
indigenous to Monterey, but it is possible that
the nut of the wild buck-eye, which resembles the
chestnut in size and shape, may have been mistaken
for it by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Vizcaíno named the port in honor of Gaspar de
Zúñiga, Count of Monterey, at that time Viceroy
of Mexico. The word itself, whose literal meaning
is “the King’s wood,” or “the King’s mountain,”
since <i>monte</i> may be used in either sense, was formerly
spelled Monterrey, Monterey, or Monte Rey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>When Father Serra arrived at Monterey in
1770, he decided to make it the headquarters of
all the California missions, and it was there that
the rest of his life was spent, excepting the periods
of absence required in visiting the other missions,
and in one visit to Mexico. Very shortly after
the landing of the party in a little cove at the
edge of the present town, it was decided that not
enough arable land existed at that point for the
support of the mission, so the religious establishment
was removed to Carmel Bay, while the
Presidio and its chapel remained at Monterey.</p>

<p>The Mission <i>San Carlos Borroméo</i> (St. Charles
Borroméo), was founded June 3, 1770, near the
shore of the charming little bay of Carmel, about
seven miles from Monterey. This church, now
in an excellent state of repair, through the efforts
of the late Father Ángelo Casanova, is distinguished
above all the others, “for under its altar
lies buried all that is mortal of the remains of its
venerable founder, Junípero Serra.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Its patron saint, St. Charles Borroméo, belonged
to a noble family of Lombardy. Being a second
son, he was dedicated to the church at a very
early age, and soon rose to distinction, receiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the cardinal’s hat at twenty-three. The death
of his elder brother placed the family fortune
at his disposal, but he gave it all in charity,
reserving for himself merely enough for bread and
water, and straw on which to sleep. In public
he gave feasts, but never partook of them himself.
At the time of the plague in Milan, when all
others fled from the city, he remained to attend
the sick. His remains repose in a rich shrine in
that city.</p>

<h3>SAN ANTONIO</h3>

<p>At <i>San Antonio</i> (St. Anthony), in Monterey
County, between Kings City and Jolón, Father
Serra established the mission of San Antonio de
Padua, July 14, 1771. In connection with its
establishment, Palou tells a story that brings out
one of the most marked characteristics of the
venerable founder, his ardent enthusiasm:
“They [the founding party] departed for the
Santa Lucía Mountains, taking priests for the
new mission, the required escort of soldiers, and
all necessaries. Twenty-five leagues south-southeast
from Monterey, they arrived at the hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of this ridge, where they found a great <i>cañada</i>,
which they called <i>Robles</i> (oaks), from the great
number of those trees. Finding a level plain in
the same <i>cañada</i>, bordering on a river which they
called <i>San Antonio</i>, and which they thought to
be a good site, for the good flow of water, even in
the dry month of July, which could be conducted
to the lands without difficulty, all agreed upon
the choice of this spot. Serra ordered the mules
to be unloaded, and the bells to be hung up on the
branch of a tree. As soon as they were hung up,
he began to ring them, crying out, ‘Ho! Gentiles,
come, come to the Holy Church, come to receive
the faith of Jesus Christ!’” One of the other
priests remonstrated with him, saying it was idle
to ring the bells in the absence of the gentiles,
but Serra said, “Let me ring, let me relieve my
heart, so that all the wild people in this mountain
range may hear!” It happened that some natives
were attracted by the ringing of the bells, and
came to witness the first mass, which Serra regarded
as a good augury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Anthony of Padua, the patron of this place,
was a Portuguese by birth, who entered the Franciscan
Order. He went as a missionary to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Moors, but was compelled by illness to return to
Europe, where he had great success in Italy and
France as a preacher. Among many miracles
accredited to him is the one thus related: “When
preaching at the funeral of a very rich man, St.
Anthony denounced his love of money, and
exclaimed, ‘His heart is buried in his treasure
chest; go seek it there and you will find it.’ The
friends of the man broke open the chest, and to
their surprise, found the heart; they then
examined his body and found that his heart was
indeed wanting.”—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>)</p>

<h3>POINT CYPRESS</h3>

<p><i>La Punta de los Cipreses</i> (Point Cypress), is
the home of those wonderful trees, twisted and
gnarled into a thousand fantastic shapes by their
age-long struggle against the ocean winds, which
furnish yet another proof of the part played by
California in the preservation of the rare and the
unique, for this species of coniferous tree is said
to be confined to that region, not occurring in
any other part of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The following interesting paragraph on these
trees is quoted from <i>The Trees of California</i>, by
Willis Linn Jepsen, Asst. Professor of Dendrology
in the University of California: “<i>Cupressus Macrocarpa</i>
is limited to two localities on the ocean shore
at the mouth of the Carmel river near Monterey.
The Cypress Point grove extends along the cliffs
and low bluffs from Pescadero Point to Cypress
Point, a distance of two miles, reaching inland
about one-eighth of a mile. The Point Lobos
grove is much smaller. The trees are scattered
over the summits of two headlands, and cling to
the edges of the cliffs, where on account of the
erosive action of the ocean, they are occasionally
under-mined and fall into the sea. Monterey
Cypress is most interesting for its remarkably
restricted natural range and the exceedingly
picturesque outlines characteristic of the trees
growing on the ocean shore. As a result of their
struggle with violent storms from the Pacific
Ocean which break on the unprotected cliffs and
headlands of Cypress Point and Point Lobos,
they present a variety and singularity of form
which is obviously connected with their exposed
habitat, and lends a never-failing interest to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
two narrow localities. Of the highly picturesque
trees, the most common type is that with long
irregular arms. Such trees recall most strikingly
the classical pictures of the Cedars of Lebanon.
Monterey Cypress is of course a genuine cypress
and Lebanon Cedar a genuine cedar; the two do
not even belong to the same family of conifers.
Yet the popular story that the two are the same
makes so strong an appeal to the imagination of
the tourist at Monterey that the guides and promoters
in the region will doubtless never cease to
disseminate it. As a consequence the error goes
into the daily press and the magazines, and is
evidently destined to flourish in perennial greenness
under the guise of fact. The wide dissemination
of this fiction is all the more remarkable in
that in the case of all other unique features of the
state, such as the Sequoias and the Yosemite, our
Californians have evinced a remarkable pride in
their possession, without thought of inventing a
duplication of them elsewhere....
The matter of the age of these trees has been much
exaggerated. It is a tree of rapid growth, and the
older specimens are probably not more than 200
or 300 years old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The above paragraph, quoted from a writer
acknowledged to be one of the best authorities
on the trees of California, is given here in full, in
the hope of correcting these two common errors
concerning the Monterey Cypress,—the one that
it is identical with the Cedar of Lebanon, the
other, an exaggerated notion of the great age of
some of the trees. As Professor Jepsen justly
remarks, the truth in this case is a greater matter
for pride than the fiction.</p>

<h3>POINT PINOS</h3>

<p><i>La Punta de Pinos</i> (the point of pines), is situated
a few miles from Monterey, just beyond
Pacific Grove. It is one of the most picturesque
points on the coast, and is the location of one of
the government light-houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h3>SALINAS</h3>

<p>When the Portolá expedition of 1769 arrived
at the Salinas River, they made the first of the
series of errors which caused them to pass by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
bay of Monterey without recognizing it, for they
mistook this stream for the Carmel. The <i>Salinas</i>
(salt marshes), so-called for the chain of salt-water
ponds lying along its course, was known by
various names before a permanent one became
attached to it, appearing at different times as
<i>El Río Elzeario</i>, <i>Santa Delfina</i>, and <i>El Río de
Monterey</i>.</p>

<p>The town of Salinas is the county-seat of
Monterey County and is situated about eighteen
miles east of Monterey, in the heart of an important
agricultural, dairying, and sugar-beet
district.</p>

<h3>SOLEDAD</h3>

<p><i>Soledad</i> (solitude), in Monterey County, 143
miles southeast of San Francisco, is described as
“a very dry plain, with few trees, swept by fierce
winds and dust storms in summer.” No wonder
they called it <i>Soledad</i>,—Lonesometown!</p>

<p>Yet those same dry plains proved to be of
sufficient fertility to warrant the establishment,
in 1791, of the mission of <i>Nuestra Señora de la
Soledad</i>, freely translated as “Our Lady of Sorrows,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
which became the center of a large and
prosperous Indian community. The buildings of
the mission have now fallen into almost complete
decay.</p>

<h3>PÁJARO</h3>

<p><i>Pájaro</i> (bird), a town in Monterey County, on
the Pájaro River, which rises on the slope of the
Coast Range, and flows westerly, falling into
Monterey Bay, derives its name from a circumstance
told in the diary of the faithful Father
Crespi: “We saw in this place a bird, which the
<i>Gentiles</i> (unbaptized Indians), had killed and
stuffed with straw, and which appeared to some
[of the party] to be a royal eagle; it was measured
from tip to tip of the wings, and was found to
measure eleven palms (nine feet and three inches),
for which reason the soldiers called the place
<i>El Río del Pájaro</i>.” The scream of the eagle
may still be heard in the more remote parts of
the Santa Cruz Mountains, where the great birds
are occasionally seen circling far over-head, or
perched in the tops of the tallest trees.</p>

<h3>SANTA CRUZ</h3>

<p><i>Santa Cruz</i> (holy cross), the well-known seaside
resort lying at the northern hook of the great
curve that forms Monterey Bay, was named by
the Portolá expedition, as thus described by
Father Crespi: “We camped on the north side
of the river [San Lorenzo], and we had a great
deal of work to cut down trees to open a little
passage for our beasts.... Not far
from the river we saw a fertile spot where the grass
was not burnt, and it was a pleasure to see the
pasture and the variety of herbs and rose-bushes
of Castile.” The next day they moved on again,
and the diary continues: “After proceeding
about five hundred steps, we passed a large
stream of running water, which has its source
among some high hills and passes through some
great table-lands of good soil, that may easily be
irrigated by the waters of the said creek. This
creek was named <i>Santa Cruz</i>.”</p>

<p>A mission was established at this place by
Padres Salazar and López, September 25, 1791,
but the buildings finally fell into a ruinous condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and were removed to give place to the
modern church which now stands upon the
original site.</p>

<h3>SAN JUAN BAUTISTA</h3>

<p><i>San Juan Bautista</i> (St. John the Baptist), has
suffered mutilation by the dropping of its last
part, and usually appears as <i>San Juan</i>. San Juan
is a small town in San Benito County, in a fertile
valley on the San Benito River, forty-four miles
southeast of San José. At this place the mission
of San Juan Bautista was founded, June 24, 1797.
Although this mission passed through some
strenuous experiences, and was twice attacked
by the Indians, and somewhat damaged by repeated
earthquakes in 1800, it is still moderately
well preserved.</p>

Benito County now known by its English translation,
“Bitter Water,” and so-called from mineral
springs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Año Neuvo</i> (new year), is the name of a prominent
cape running out from the shore of Santa
Cruz County, where one of the coast light-houses
is situated. It received its name from the day of
its discovery.</p>

<p><i>Arroyo Seco</i> (dry creek). The Arroyo Seco,
rising in the Santa Lucía Range and flowing
northeasterly into the Salinas River, is probably
the most remarkable example of terrace formation
to be found among the streams of the state.</p>

<p>There are other Arroyo Secos in the state, one
near Los Ángeles which is very striking in its
color effects.</p>

<p><i>Blanco</i> (white), is a town in Monterey County

Francisco. The <i>chual</i> is a wild plant of California,—pig-weed
or goose-foot, and <i>chualar</i>
is a spot abounding in chual plants.</p>

<p><i>Corral</i> (yard, enclosed place). On October 11,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
1769, the Portolá party stopped at a place about
a league from the Pájaro River, where they constructed
a fence between a lake and a low hill, in
order to keep the animals secure at night without
the need of many watchmen. Palou, in his
<i>Life of Serra</i>, says: “The first expedition called
this place the <i>Corral</i>, on account of having built
there, with some sticks nailed together, a pasture
in the manner of a yard, in order to keep the
animals safe at night. This was of great assistance,
for there were so many sick that there were
not enough [people] to guard the animals.” In
different parts of the state there were many
<i>Corrals</i> and <i>Corralitos</i> (little yards). Sometimes
the enclosing fence was made of stones, when
more convenient, and the enclosure was then
called <i>Corral de Piedra</i> (stone corral); sometimes
a barricade of earth was thrown up, and it was
then called <i>Corral de Tierra</i> (earth corral). <i>Corral
de Tierra</i> is the name of a well-known ranch near
Monterey. In the days of old, many a joyous
<i>merienda</i> (picnic) and barbecue was held at the
Corral de Tierra Rancho. <i>Corralitos</i> (little corrals),
is in Santa Cruz County, fourteen miles
east of Santa Cruz.</p>

name of the long mountain ridge, a branch of
the Coast Range, which extends through the
counties of San Matéo and Santa Cruz.</p>

<p><i>Gonzales</i> (a surname). This place is in Monterey
County, in the Salinas valley, seventeen miles
southeast of Salinas.</p>

<p><i>Gorda</i> (fat, thick).</p>

<p><i>Las Grullas</i> (the cranes). In the diaries of the
Portolá expedition, date of October 7, 1769, we
read: “We pitched our camp between some low
hills near a pond, where we saw a great number
of cranes, the first we had seen on this journey.”
This was about four leagues from the Pájaro
River.</p>

<p><i>Jolón</i>, a word of doubtful origin, which has been
variously explained. It is thought by some persons
to be a corruption of Jalón, a proper name, but
old Spanish residents say it is an Indian word,
meaning “valley of dead oaks.”</p>

<p><i>Llanada</i> (a plain, level ground). This place is
in San Benito County.</p>

<p><i>Laureles</i> (laurels). <i>Los Laureles</i> is the name of a
ranch near Monterey. The wild laurel is a shrub
common to many parts of the state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lobos</i> (wolves), generally used on this coast in
the sense of <i>lobo marino</i>, (sea-wolf, or seal). There
is a <i>Punta de Lobos</i> (seal point), near Monterey
which is noted for the bold grandeur of its ocean
scenery, as well as for its seals.</p>

<p><i>Loma Prieta</i> (dark hill), is the name of a peak
in the Santa Cruz Mountains.</p>

<p><i>Moro Cojo</i> (literally “lame Moor”), is the name
of a well-known ranch in Monterey County. The
Spaniards were in the habit of using <i>moro</i> to mean
anything black, and in this case, according to
old residents, the ranch was named for a lame
black horse that ran wild there.</p>

<p><i>Natividad</i> (nativity of Christ), is the name of
a town in Monterey County, about one hundred
miles southeast of San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>Paicines</i> is in San Benito County. This is a
word of doubtful origin, and many theories have
been advanced to account for it. The most
probable is that given by an Indian woman, a
resident of the place, who says it was the
name of an Indian tribe. The word is also
sometimes spelled <i>Pajines</i>. See <i>Tres Pinos</i>,
page 98.</p>

<p><i>Panocha</i> is in San Benito County. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
word applied to crude sugar, or syrup, somewhat
resembling sorghum. Probably modern.</p>

<p><i>Paraíso Springs</i> (paradise springs), is a health
resort in Monterey County.</p>

<p><i>Pleito</i> (quarrel, argument, lawsuit). This place
is in Monterey County. It has not been possible
to ascertain the application of its name.</p>

<p><i>Potrero</i> (pasture). There were many <i>potreros</i>
scattered about the state.</p>

<p><i>Puentes</i> (bridges). This place, two leagues
from the San Lorenzo River, was reached by the
Portolá, party October 18, 1769, and the reason
for its naming is explained by Miguel Costansó:
“These canyons contained running water in very
deep ditches, over which it was necessary to lay
bridges of logs, covered with earth and bundles
of sticks, so that the pack animals could cross.
The place was called <i>Las Puentes</i>.”</p>

<p><i>San Benito</i> (St. Benedict), was named in honor
of the founder of the great order of Benedictines.
San Benito Creek was named in 1772 by Father
Crespi, and the name was eventually applied to
the county. The town of San Benito is on the
Salinas River, sixty miles southeast of Monterey.
It is said of St. Benedict that he became a hermit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
at the age of fifteen and fled to the wilderness,
where he lived on bread and water. While there
he was tempted by the remembrance of a beautiful
woman he had seen in Rome, and to overcome
his wish to see her again “he flung himself
into a thicket of briers and thorns, and rolled
himself therein until he was torn and bleeding.
At the monastery of Subiaco they show roses,
said to have been propagated from these briers.”</p>

<p><i>San Lucas</i> (St. Luke), is in Monterey County,
sixty miles southeast of Salinas. St. Luke was
the disciple of Paul, who speaks of him as “Luke,
the beloved physician,” but tradition reports
him to have been an artist, and that he always
carried with him two portraits, one of the Saviour
and the other of Mary. Doubtless for this reason
he is regarded as the patron of artists and academies
of art.</p>

<p><i>Sur</i> (south). Point Sur (south point), on the
coast south of Monterey, is a bold promontory
where a light-house was placed by the government,
in consequence of the frequent occurrence
of shipwrecks there. The Sur River runs
through a region remarkable for the wild picturesqueness
of its scenery, and for the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
tales told of happenings among its early
inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Toro</i> (bull), is the name of a ranch near Monterey,
said to have been so-called after a wild bull.</p>

<p><i>Tres Pinos</i> (three pines), a place in San Benito
County, one hundred miles southeast of San Francisco.
Postmaster Black, of Tres Pinos, gives us
the following history of the naming of this place:
“The name was originally applied to what is now
known as <i>Paicines</i>, but when the railroad came
to this place they appropriated the name of
Tres Pinos, hence it has no significance as applied
to this town. The name was given the stopping-place
now known as Paicines because of three
pines alleged to have grown on the banks of the
Tres Pinos creek near that place. Paicines, then
Tres Pinos, was the scene of the Vásquez raid and
murders in the early ’70’s.”</p>

<p><i>Uvas</i> (grapes), the name of a town and creek
in the Santa Cruz Mountains, no doubt so-called
from the abundance of wild grapes found in that
locality.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY</span></h2>

<p><i>Santa Clara.</i> When the Spaniards passed
through this valley, they were not slow to recognize
in it one of those favored spots on the earth’s
surface where climate and soil unite to produce
the highest results. So here they founded two
missions, one at Santa Clara, and one at San José.</p>

<p><i>Santa Clara</i> (St. Clara), stands in one of the
most fertile valleys in California, which is equivalent
to saying in the whole world, and is about
forty-six miles south-southeast of San Francisco.
The mission was founded by Padres Peña and
Murguia, January 12, 1777. The buildings now
standing are mainly modern, but a small portion
of the original structure being incorporated in
them. The ceiling over the sanctuary is original,
and a small part of the adobe buildings.</p>

<p>Clara de Asís, the sweet saint for whom this
mission was named, was the daughter of a nobleman.
Her beauty and wealth brought her
many offers of marriage, all of which she refused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
preferring to devote herself to a religious life.
She became the founder of the order of Franciscan
nuns, known as the “Poor Clares,” to which many
noble ladies attached themselves. The rules of
the order were so strict that St. Clara’s health
finally became under-mined, and she died in
an ecstatic trance, believing herself called to
Heaven by angelic voices. Her special symbol is
the lily, peculiarly appropriate for the patroness
of the ever-blooming Santa Clara Valley.</p>

<h3>SAN JOSÉ</h3>

<p><i>San José</i> (St. Joseph), enjoys the distinction
of having been the first white colony planted in
the state by the Spaniards, although when we
read the complaints of the padres concerning the
highly undesirable character of its first settlers,
recruited mainly from the criminal classes of
Sonora, the distinction would seem to be of rather
a doubtful sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">“The special symbol of the sweet St. Clara is the lily, peculiarly appropriate for the ever-blooming
Santa Clara Valley.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Spurred on by the old bogie of their fear of
foreign invasion, the Spanish government decided
to establish colonies of white settlers, believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that their hold upon the country would be rendered
more secure by this means. The pueblo of
San José de Guadalupe, founded November 29,
1777, by Lieutenant José Moraga, then in command
at San Francisco, under orders from Governor
Neve, was originally located on a site about
a mile and a quarter distant from the present city,
but was removed in 1797, in consequence of the
discovery that the low-lying ground of its first
location was often submerged during the winter
rains. The people of the pueblo were compelled
to travel a distance of three miles to attend mass
at the Santa Clara Mission, and in order to make
this journey more agreeable, Father Maguín de
Catala laid out the <i>alameda</i> between the two
places, planting a fine avenue of willow trees which
once comforted the wayfarer with their grateful
shade. The original trees have now practically
all disappeared and others have taken their places
in part. The old alameda has vanished.</p>

<p>Not until 1797 was the mission of San José
founded, on a spot some fourteen miles distant
from the pueblo. The padres had no keen desire
to place the missions in close proximity to the
pueblos, fearing the evil influence on the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of a bad class of white men, besides other inevitable
complications, such as the mixing up of cattle.
Father Engelhardt, in his <i>History of the California
Missions</i>, tells the story of the founding of the
Mission San José thus: “Here, on Trinity Sunday,
June 11, 1797, Father Lasuén raised and
blessed the cross. In a shelter of boughs he celebrated
Holy Mass, and thus dedicated the mission
in honor of the foster-father of Christ, St. Joseph.”</p>

<p>The old church was unfortunately so shattered
by an earthquake in 1868 that it was torn down
and replaced by a wooden edifice.</p>

<p>It should be made clear that two missions were
established here, Santa Clara and San José, and
that the latter was not at San José, as some maps
represent it, but some fourteen miles distant from
the town.</p>

<h3>PALO ALTO</h3>

<p><i>Palo Alto</i> (high stick, or tree), in Santa Clara
County, sixteen miles northwest of San José, once
a stock farm where blooded horses were raised,
now best known as the site of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, is said to have received its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
name from a tall redwood tree on the <i>San Francisquito</i>
(little St. Francis) creek. This tree
stands just a few feet from the railroad bridge
near Palo Alto station, and is said by old residents
to have originally been in the form of a twin tree,
one of the twins having been cut down. The
trees of this species received the name <i>Palo
Colorado</i> (red stick, or tree), from the Portolá
party, whose attention was attracted by their
uncommon size and the peculiar reddish color of
the wood, and the honor of their discovery may
justly be awarded to Gaspar de Portolá, since he
seems to have been the first white man to make
report of having seen them.</p>

<p>This place was named by the Anza expedition
of 1775-1776, and it seems rather strange that no
mention is made in the diaries of the fact that the
tree was a twin. Father Pedro Font, who accompanied
the expedition, says: “From a slight
eminence I here observed the lay of the port from
this point and saw that its extremity lay to the
east-southeast. I also noticed that a very high
spruce tree, which is to be seen at a great distance,
rising up like a great tower, from the <i>Llano
de los Robles</i>,—it stands on the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<i>Arroyo de San Francisco</i>, later on I measured its
height—lay to the southeast.” Further on in the
diary he says: “Beside this stream is the redwood
tree I spoke of yesterday: I measured its height
with the graphometer which they lent me at the
mission of San Carlos, and, according to my
reckoning, found it to be some fifty yards high,
more or less; the trunk was five yards and a half
in circumference at the base, and the soldiers said
that there were still larger ones in the mountains.”—(Translation
edited by Frederick J. Teggart.)
This description of Father Font’s gives rise to a
strong suspicion that the tree now so highly
venerated is not the original Palo Alto from which
the place takes its name. The name was first
applied to a land grant.</p>

<h3>LA SALUD</h3>

<p><i>La Salud</i> (health). In the name of this place,
not far from the San Lorenzo River, reached by
the Portolá party on October 22, there is a reference
to one of the heaviest of the afflictions from
which the Spaniards suffered during their journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
up the state,—serious sickness and many deaths
from scurvy. To their great surprise, after a
wetting received during a heavy storm at this
place, all the sick began to recover. Costansó,
in his diary, date of October 22, says: “The day
dawned overcast and gloomy. The men were
wet. What excited our wonder was that all the
sick, for whom we greatly feared that the wetting
might prove harmful, suddenly found their pains
very much relieved. This was the reason for
giving the canyon the name of <i>La Salud</i>.”—(Translation
edited by Frederick J. Teggart.)</p>

<h3>LOS GATOS</h3>

<p><i>Los Gatos</i> (the cats), is the rather unpoetic
name of a very pretty town in Santa Clara
County, ten miles southwest of San José. From
its location at the mouth of a canyon in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, the inference may be drawn
that it was named in reference to the wild-cats
which even at this day infest that region. John
Charles Fremont, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, says: “The
valley is openly wooded with groves of oak, free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from under-brush, and after the spring rains covered
with grass. On the west it is protected from
the chilling influence of the northwest winds by
the <i>Cuesta de los Gatos</i> (wild-cat ridge), which
separates it from the coast.”</p>

<p>“It seems to have been known as early as 1831
as <i>La Cuesta de los Gatos</i>. That there were troublous
times about there in other matters besides
wild-cats is evidenced by the story of a lively
fight that took place in 1831 against a band of
Indians under a chief named Yoscol. This chief
was eventually captured by the Santa Clara
authorities and beheaded, his head being exposed
in front of the mission as a warning to others.”—(W.
Drummond Norie, of Los Gatos.)</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Almadén</i> (mine, mineral), a word of Moorish
origin. New Álmadén, in Santa Clara County,
where there is a quicksilver mine, is named after
the famous <i>Almadén</i> quicksilver mines of Spain.</p>

<p><i>Alviso</i> (a surname). Alviso is in Santa Clara
County, eight miles northwest of San José, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
received its name from Ignacio Alviso, a native
of Sonora, born in 1772, who was a member of
Anza’s party of colonists in 1775-6. He was the
original Alviso of California, and was the grantee
of <i>Rincón de los Esteros Rancho</i>.</p>

<p><i>Arroyo Hondo</i> (deep creek).</p>

<p><i>Coyote</i>, the native wolf of California. Coyote
is an Aztec word, originally <i>coyotl</i>. The town of
this name is situated thirteen miles southeast of
San José.</p>

<p><i>Las Llagas</i> (the wounds or stigmata of St.
Francis),—in reference to the legend that St.
Francis was supposed to have received, after a
fast of fifty days, the miraculous imprint of the
wounds of the Savior in his hands, feet and side.
<i>Las Llagas</i> was the name of a place near Gilroy,
and was also given by the padres to Alameda
Creek.</p>

<p><i>Madroño</i>, often misspelled <i>madrone</i>, is the name
given by the Spaniards to a very beautiful tree
indigenous to California, which is thus described
by Fremont in his <i>Memoirs</i>: “Another remarkable
tree of these woods is called in the language of the
country <i>Madroña</i>. It is a beautiful evergreen,
with large, thick and glossy digitated leaves; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
trunk and branches reddish-colored, and having
a smooth and singularly naked appearance, as if
the bark had been stripped off. In its green state
the wood is brittle, very heavy, hard and close-grained;
it is said to assume a red color when dry,
sometimes variegated, and susceptible of a high
polish. Some measured nearly four feet in
diameter, and were about sixty feet high.”</p>

<p><i>Milpitas</i>, see page <a href="#Page_232">232</a>.</p>

<p><i>San Felipe</i> (St. Philip), is the name of a village
in Santa Clara County. There were four saints
of this name, perhaps the most distinguished
being St. Philip Neri, a Florentine, born in 1515.
He was the intimate friend of St. Charles Borroméo,
patron of the mission at Monterey, and
was the founder of the order of the Oratorians,
“who were bound by no vows, and were not
secluded from the world, but went about reading
and praying with the sick and needy, founding
and visiting hospitals and doing various charities.”
Then there was St. Philip of Bethsaida,
who, going to Hieropolis, “found the people worshipping
a huge serpent, or dragon, which they
thought to be a personification of Mars. Then
Philip took pity on their ignorance. He held up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the cross and commanded the serpent to disappear.
Immediately it glided from beneath the
altar, and as it moved it sent forth so dreadful
an odor that many died, and among them the
son of the King; but Philip restored him to life.
Then the priests of the serpent were so wroth
with the apostle that they crucified him, and when
he was fastened to the cross they stoned him.”—(<i>Stories
of the Saints.</i>)</p>

<p><i>San Martín</i> (St. Martin), is a town in Santa
Clara County, six miles north of Gilroy. St.
Martin has many legends connected with his
history. Before he became a Christian, he was a
soldier and was noted for his kindness and charity
to his comrades. “The winter of 332 was so
severely cold that large numbers perished in the
streets of Amiens, where the regiment of St.
Martin was quartered. One day he met at the
gate a naked man, and taking pity on him, he
divided his cloak, for it was all he had, and gave
half to the beggar. That night in a dream Jesus
stood before him, and on his shoulders he wore
the half of the cloak that Martin had given the
beggar. And he said to the angels who attended
him, ‘Know ye who hath thus arrayed me? My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
servant Martin, though yet unbaptized, hath
done this.’ Then Martin was immediately baptized.”
Again it is told of him that being invited
to sup with the emperor, “the cup was passed to
Martin, before his Majesty drank, with the expectation
that he would touch it to his lips, as
was the custom. But a poor priest stood behind
Martin, and to the surprise and admiration of
all, the saint presented the full goblet to him,
thus signifying that a servant of God deserved
more honor, however humble his station, than
any merely earthly potentate; from this legend
he has been chosen the patron of all innocent
conviviality.”—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>)</p>

<span class="smaller">AROUND SAN FRANCISCO BAY</span></h2>

<p><i>San Francisco.</i> Many persons, misled by an
incorrect translation of a certain passage in
Palou’s <i>Life of Serra</i>, have ascribed the naming of
the bay of San Francisco (St. Francis), to the
Portolá expedition of 1769, but, as a matter of
fact, the outer bay, the great indentation in the
coast outside of the Golden Gate, between Point
Reyes and Mussel Point, had received this name
many years before. In remonstrating with the
<i>Visitador General</i> because no mission had been
provided for St. Francis in Upper California,
Serra remarked, “And is there no mission for our
Father St. Francis?” Señor Galvez replied,
“<i>Si San Francisco quiere misión, que haga se
halla su puerto y se le pondrá</i> (If St. Francis wants
a mission, let him cause his port to be found and
one will be placed there for him).” By “his
port” Galvez referred to a port already discovered
and named, but which had been lost sight of during
the intervening years, and which he wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
have re-discovered. This is further carried out
by the succeeding statements of Palou, in which
he says that after failing to recognize the port of
Monterey, “they came to the port of St. Francis,
our father, and they all knew it immediately by
the agreement of the descriptions which they
carried,” referring to descriptions obtained from
the papers of the first discoverers. Father Crespi,
who accompanied the expedition, says: “All the
descriptions which we found here we read in the
log-book of the pilot Cabrera Bueno, in order to
form a judgment that this is the port of San
Francisco. To make it all clear, the <i>Señor Commandante</i>
ordered that during the day Sergeant
Ortega should go out with a party of soldiers to
explore.” Further on in the same diary we read:
“From the top of a hill we made out the great
estuary, or arm of the sea, which probably has a
width of four or five leagues.” This is undoubtedly
the first occasion when the eye of a white man
rested upon “the great arm of the sea,” that is,
the inner harbor of San Francisco as we now
know it.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CITY OF YERBA BUENA (SAN FRANCISCO IN 1846-47)</p>
<p class="caption">“ ... so-called in reference to the profuse growth of that charming little vine about the locality.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that until the arrival
of Portolá, the Spaniards only knew this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the coast from the sea side, having no knowledge
of that great inland sea known to us as the bay of
San Francisco. When the party came up by
land on their futile search for Monterey, they
reached Fort Point, and there recognized the
marks of the outer bay as given by early navigators
and called by them <i>San Francisco</i>. Then
they climbed a hill, and looking to the landward
saw the “great arm of the sea,” the inner harbor,
to which the name of San Francisco was finally
extended.</p>

<p>Palou ascribed the failure of the party to recognize
the port of Monterey, and the consequent
continuance of their journey as far as San Francisco,
to a direct interposition of the divine hand,
so that Galvez’s promise of a mission for St.
Francis might be carried out.</p>

<p>The honor of the christening of our world-famous
bay probably belongs to Sebastián Rodríguez
Cermeñón, a Portuguese navigator, who was
commissioned in the year 1595 by Philip II to
search for safe harbors along the coast for vessels
in the Philippine trade. These ships usually
shaped their return course so as to touch first at
about the latitude of Cape Mendocino, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a knowledge of the harbors south of that point
a matter of great importance, especially in stormy
weather. Cermeñón had the misfortune to lose
his vessel, the San Agustín, on Point Reyes, and
was compelled to make his way home, with great
peril and suffering, in a small boat. In his <i>Derrotero
y Relación</i> (Itinerary and Narrative),
under date of April 24, 1596, he says: “We
sighted New Spain at Cape Mendocino on November
4, 1595.... We left the bay
and port of San Francisco, which is called by
another name, a large bay, in 38⅔ degrees, and
the islets [Farallones] in the mouth are in 38½
degrees, the distance between the two points of
the bay being twenty-five leagues.” It is clear
from this description that he referred to that
great indentation in the coast between Point
Reyes and one of the points to the south, possibly
Mussel Point, and that he gave the name of San
Francisco to it, displacing some other name by
which it had been previously known. At any
rate, if this is not the origin, it is likely to remain
lost in the mists of the Pacific. Bancroft says:
“There can be little doubt that Cermeñón named
the port of his disaster <i>San Francisco</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>An absurd theory advanced by certain persons
that the name was derived from that of Sir
Francis Drake is wholly unworthy of consideration.
The resemblance between the two names
must be regarded as purely a co-incidence, and
any connection between “<i>El Pirata</i>” (the pirate)
Drake, as the Spaniards usually called him, and
the name of the gentle St. Francis must be taken
in the light of a jest.</p>

<p>Portolá, then, although he was indubitably
the discoverer of the bay as we know it,—the
inner harbor,—found the name already applied
to the outer <i>ensenada</i> by his predecessor, Cermeñón.</p>

<p>It is held by some persons that Portolá cannot
in all fairness be considered the actual discoverer
of the bay, since it is most probable that Lieutenant
Ortega or perhaps some member of a hunting
party which was sent out actually laid physical
eyes upon it first, and it is even thought possible
that Portolá never saw it at all, but remained in
camp all the time during their stay on its shores.
Even granting these facts, the question remains
whether he, as the commander of the party making
the expedition which resulted in the discovery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
is not still entitled to the fame which has
generally been granted to him.</p>

<p>A parallel might be drawn between the case of
Portolá and that of Columbus. When the famous
expedition of 1492 drew near to the shores of the
new world, it was not the great admiral, but a
common sailor, Rodrigo de Triana by name, who
first raised the thrilling cry of “land! land!”; yet,
nevertheless, the world justly awards the honor
and glory of the discovery to Christopher Columbus,
the leader and the soul of the party, whose
splendid imagination and unconquerable resolution
made it possible.</p>

<p>Although the Portolá party made a partial
examination at this time of the shores of what
they called the “great arm of the sea,” and Captain
Fages returned for further explorations in
1770, and again in 1772, when he stood on the
present site of Berkeley and looked out through
the Golden Gate, the mission was not established
until 1776. Father Palou was its founder, and
he states in his <i>Life of Serra</i> that the presidio
was established with solemn religious services,
September 17, 1776, on the day of the “impressions
of the stigmata of St. Francis,” but on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
a delay in receiving orders, the founding of the
mission did not take place until October 9. On
that day a procession was held with the image of
St. Francis, and mass was celebrated by Father
Palou himself.</p>

<p>So they prayed and sang their hymns, in the
year of ’76, while their hearts beat high with the
zeal of the missionary, and, happily, no echo of
the roll of drums and boom of minute guns came
to them across the untrodden miles of mountain
and plain, of forest and prairie, that separated
them from the alien race on the other rim of the
continent, for whom they were all unconsciously
preparing the way to the possession of a great
principality.</p>

<p>No natives were present at this mass, for the
reason that in the month of August they had been
driven on their tule rafts to the islands of the bay
and the opposite shores, by their enemies, the
Salsonas, who lived about seven leagues to the
southeast, and who had set fire to their <i>rancherías</i>
and killed and wounded many of their people,
the Spaniards not being able to prevent it.</p>

<p>The first settlement was three-fold, including
the mission of <i>San Francisco de Asís</i>, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
<i>Laguna de los Dolores</i> (the lagoon of sorrows),
the presidio, and the pueblo, separated from one
another by about a league. The Pueblo was at
first known as <i>Yerba Buena</i>, in reference to the
profuse growth of that vine about the locality.
The change of the name is ascribed by General
Sherman, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, to jealousy of the town
of Benicia, which was at first called <i>Francisca</i>,
in honor of General Vallejo’s wife, and was
thought to bear too marked a resemblance to the
name of the great patron, San Francisco. General
Vallejo himself states that the change was
made as a matter of convenience, to bring the three
points of the triangle, church, town, and presidio,
all under one name. Whatever the reason for
the change, it is a matter of congratulation that
it occurred, for the name of the venerable saint
carries a dignity more commensurate to a noble
city than the poetic, but less impressive <i>Yerba
Buena</i>.</p>

<p>The church of <i>San Francisco de Asís</i>, popularly
known as <i>Mission Dolores</i>, still stands in a good
state of preservation, having almost miraculously
withstood the earthquake and fire of 1906, which
laid low all its proud modern neighbors. Of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
patron, the gentle St. Francis, it may be said that
he was the son of a rich merchant, but that he
abandoned his riches, adopted vows of poverty,
and founded the order of Franciscans. “While
in a trance, or vision, after having fasted for fifty
days, he received the miraculous imprint of the
wounds of the Savior on his hands, feet, and side.”
His chief attributes were humility, poverty, and
love for animals. In pictures he is always represented
as accompanied by a pet lamb.</p>

<h3>THE GOLDEN GATE</h3>

<p>Although this name, not being of Spanish or
Indian origin, is not properly included in these
pages, its close relationship to San Francisco,
and its position as the gate-way to the entire
state, will not permit it to be passed by.</p>

<p>In view of the comparatively recent origin of
the name, 1844, and the accessibility of the story,
it seems strange indeed that any writer should
have advanced the theory that the Golden Gate
received its name from Sir Francis Drake, yet
this wholly unfounded explanation has found its
way into print. In the first place, it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
pretty thoroughly established by historians that
Drake never saw the inner harbor, and knew
nothing of the narrow strait leading to it. In the
report of his voyage, written by one of his companions,
we read: “At 38 degrees toward the line,
it pleased God to send us into a faire and good
harborow, with a good wind to enter the same.
Our General called this country <i>Nova Albion</i>, and
that for two causes;—the one in respect of the
white bankes and cliffes, which ly toward the
sea; and the other that it might have some
affinity with our country in name, which sometime
was so-called.” The white cliffs under Point
Reyes answer so well to this description that
there can be little doubt that Drake’s anchorage
was in the small outer bay under that point, now
known as Drake’s Bay; to say nothing of the fact
that the account of the voyage has no word concerning
the great land-locked harbor, with a
narrow strait as its only entrance, a circumstance
so novel that, as Bancroft justly observes, Drake
could not have failed to mention it had he known
aught of it.</p>

<p>All discussion of the name <i>Golden Gate</i> is, moreover,
brought to an end by the fact that its real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
author, John Charles Fremont, gives a circumstantial
account of it in his <i>Memoirs</i>. After an
elaborate description of the bay, and its surroundings,
he says: “Between these points is
the strait,—about one mile broad in its narrowest
part, and five miles long from the sea to the bay.
To this gate I gave the name of <i>Chrysopylae</i>, or
Golden Gate; for the same reasons that the harbor
of Byzantium (Constantinople afterwards), was
called <i>Chrysoceras</i>, or Golden Horn. The form
of the harbor and its advantages for commerce,
and that before it became an <i>entrepot</i> of eastern
commerce, suggested the name to the Greek
founders of Byzantium. The form of the entrance
into the bay of San Francisco, and its advantages
for commerce, Asiatic inclusive, suggested to me
the name which I gave to this entrance, and
which I put upon the map that accompanied a
geographical memoir addressed to the senate of
the United States, in June, 1848.”</p>

<p>Here we have, told in the somewhat pedantic
language of its author, the true story of the first
appearance of the famous name <i>Golden Gate</i> upon
the map of the world, and instead of its having
been “named by Colonel Fremont because of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
brilliant effect of the setting sun on the cliffs and
hills,” as one writer has fondly imagined, or from
any idea connected with the shining metal,
which still lay buried deep from the sight of man
beneath the mountains of the land, it was born
in a sordid dream of commerce. Yet, for so
wonderfully apt a name, whatever may have been
Fremont’s motive in selecting it, we owe him a
debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>There is some disposition to doubt this explanation
of the name <i>Golden Gate</i>, partly on the
ground of a distrust of Fremont’s trustworthiness,
and partly because of its far-fetched nature. As
to the latter objection it should be remembered
that he was that kind of a man. He was possessed
of a certain amount of erudition which he
was fond of showing off, and this labored method
of seeking for a name in the old Greek was quite
in keeping with his character. As to his reliability,
although it is quite possible that he colored
events of a political character to suit his own purposes,
in ordinary matters there seems to be no
reason to doubt his statements. At all events,
the name Golden Gate does in fact appear upon
his map of 1848 as he says.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Dr. Vallejo, the Golden Gate
was called by the Indians <i>Yulupa</i>, pronounced
<i>ee-oo-loo-pa</i>, which means “near the sea plunge,”
that is, the plunge of the sun into the sea, and may
be freely translated as the “Sunset Strait.” The
suffix <i>pa</i> is said by Dr. Vallejo to signify “near.”—(<i>Memoirs
of the Vallejos</i>, edited by James H.
Wilkins, San Francisco Bulletin, January, 1914.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h3>ALCATRAZ</h3>

<p><i>Alcatraz</i> (pelican), the fortress-like island in the
bay, just inside the channel, performs the triple
duty of a fortified military post, prison, and light-house.
Although but 1650 feet in length, it rises
to a height of 130 feet above the water, and in the
shadowy light just after sunset, its high, rocky
walls, topped by the buildings of the fortifications
and prison, make a silhouette against the sky
strikingly like a great dreadnaught, standing
guard at the harbor’s entrance.</p>

<p>The story of its naming can not be run to earth,
but it probably originated in some circumstance
connected with the great sea-birds whose ungainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
forms may still be seen heavily flapping over the
bay, or resting on the island.</p>

<h3>ANGEL ISLAND</h3>

<p><i>Angel Island</i>, the Americanization of <i>La Isla
de los Ángeles</i> (the isle of the angels), belies its
name, since it has been devoted to the quite
un-angelic business of quarantine station of San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Palou, in speaking of the expedition of 1776,
says: “They moved to the island which is in
front of the mouth, which they called <i>Nuestra
Señora de los Ángeles</i> [Our Lady of the Angels],
on which they found good anchorage, and going
on land, they found plenty of wood and water.”</p>

<p>A story has found its way into print that the
island was named “from a miner who once settled
there,” the writer probably mixing it up with the
name of Angel’s Camp, in the Sierras. What a
desecration for our island, with its romantic
name of “Our Lady of the Angels,” piously
given to it by the Spaniards in honor of the
Virgin!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<h3>YERBA BUENA ISLAND</h3>

<p><i>Yerba Buena</i> (the good herb), is the name of a
dainty little vine native to the California woods,
which has an agreeable aromatic odor, and was
much in use among the Spanish as a medicinal
herb, and to add a pleasant aroma to their tea.
Fremont, who, whatever else may be said of him,
had enough poetry in his soul to feel an expansive
joy over the plant life of this flowery land, describes
it as follows: “A vine with a small white
flower, called here <i>la yerba buena</i>, which, from its
abundance, gives its name to an island and town
in the bay, was to-day very frequent on our road,
sometimes running on the ground, or climbing
the trees.” It is said that the Hupa Indians were
in the habit of weaving the tendrils of this vine
in their hair for the sake of the perfume.</p>

<p>Some talk has arisen of late that this poetic
and historic name is to be taken away from our
island. Commuters, when you pass it on your
daily journey, let your minds carry you back to
the day when the delicate tendrils of the little
vine waved on the island’s steep slopes, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sweet scent was wafted on the breeze from the
Golden Gate, and do not, I pray you, consent to
call it <i>Goat</i>!</p>

<h3>MARE ISLAND</h3>

<p><i>Mare Island</i>, in San Pablo Bay, separated from
Vallejo by a strait one-half mile wide, a charming
spot with an unpoetic name,—is another example
of writers attempting to make difficulties where
none exist, and so they would have us believe that
the name of this isle arose, like Venus, from <i>mare</i>,
the sea. Apart from the fact that this labored
method of naming places, by seeking in the Latin,
was quite foreign to the custom of the Spaniards,
it happens that the true story in this case is at
hand, and can scarcely be doubted, since it
occurred in the immediate family of Dr. Vallejo,
who tells it thus: “In early days, the only ferry-boat
on the waters near Vallejo and Benicia was
a rude one, made chiefly of oil barrels obtained
from whaling ships, and propelled by sails. These
barrels were secured together by beams and
planking, and it was divided into compartments
for the accommodation of cattle, to the transportation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of which it was chiefly devoted. One day,
while this boat was coming from Martínez to
Benicia, a sudden squall overtook it, and the craft
pitched fearfully; the animals, chiefly horses,
became restive, and some of them broke through
it. The boat was upset, and the living cargo
thrown into the bay. Some of the livestock were
drowned, and some managed to reach either shore
by swimming. One of the horses, an old white
mare, owned and much prized by General Vallejo,
succeeded in effecting a landing on the island, and
was rescued there a few days after by the General,
who thereupon called the place <i>La Isla de la
Yegua</i> (the island of the mare).”</p>

<p>An interesting corroboration of this story is
found on page 574 of Fremont’s <i>Memoirs</i>, where
he refers to the island as <i>La Isla de la Yegua</i>.</p>

<p>A statue of a white horse would perpetuate the
history of this isle in a manner both appropriate
and beautiful, in the same way that upon the
heights of Angel Island a colossal figure of an
angel, or of the Virgin, and upon Alcatraz a great
pelican with outspread wings, might be placed
to tell their stories. In the old world, many
legends of the past are perpetuated in this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and there is no reason why the equally romantic
episodes in California’s history should not be so
commemorated, at least in those cases that lend
themselves readily to purposes of art.</p>

<h3>ALAMEDA</h3>

<p>It has been thought that this name may have
been derived from the resemblance between
Alameda creek, at one time thickly shaded along
its banks by willows and silver-barked sycamores,
and an <i>alameda</i> (an avenue shaded by trees),
but since the primary meaning of the word is “a
place where poplar trees grow,” from <i>álamo</i> (poplar
or cottonwood), it requires less stretching of
the imagination to believe that some such grove
of cottonwoods near the creek gave it the name.
Fray Dantí, in his diary of the exploration of “the
Alameda” in 1795, says: “We came to the river
of the Alameda, which has many large boulders,
brought down by floods, and is well populated with
willows, alders, and here and there a laurel. At
a little distance from where the river runs, the
tides of the Estuary come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus19">

<p class="caption">THE FARALLONES.</p>
<p class="caption">“ ... standing like watch-dogs at our outer gate.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>From the name of an insignificant little stream,
<i>Alameda</i> has come to be the designation of one of
the most important counties in the state, and of
the flourishing city on the east side of San Francisco
Bay, nine miles east-southeast of San Francisco.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
This city was once known as <i>Encinal</i>
(place of oaks), on account of the groves of beautiful
live-oaks there, nearly all of which have,
most unfortunately, been sacrificed to so-called
“improvements.” Yet, some fine specimens still
remain in the county, perhaps the best being
those on the campus of the University of California,
at Berkeley, Alameda County. The
<i>encino</i> (live-oak), is thus described by Professor
Jepsen: “It is a low, broad-headed tree, commonly
twenty to forty feet, but sometimes seventy feet
high. The trunk is from one to four feet in diameter,
usually short, and parting into wide-spread
limbs, which often touch or trail along the ground.”
This tree has little commercial value, but is highly
regarded for its hardy nature, which permits it
to flourish in exposed localities along the coast,
where no other tree thrives, and for the perennial
green with which it adorns an otherwise often
bleak landscape.—(Notes taken from <i>The Trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of California</i>, by Professor Willis Linn Jepsen,
of the University of California.)</p>

<h3>LOS FARALLONES</h3>

<p><i>Los Farallones</i>, the three small islands standing
like watch-dogs at our outer gate, about thirty-two
miles due west of the entrance to the bay,
derive their name from <i>farallon</i>, a word meaning
“a small pointed island in the sea.” Although
this word is commonly employed by the Spanish
to designate such islands, and its use in this case
is perfectly obvious, the statement has been made
that our isles were named for a certain Ferolla,
one of the early navigators, a theory entirely

<p>The Farallones are frequented by multitudes
of sea-fowl, which breed there and at one time
supplied great quantities of eggs for the San
Francisco market. For some twenty years or
more the United States Government, owing to
the contentions of rival egg companies, has prohibited
the gathering and sale of these eggs.</p>

<p><i>Tamalpais</i> (bay mountain), is in Marin County,
five miles southwest of San Rafael; it rises to a
height of 2606 feet above sea level, and dominates
San Francisco Bay and the surrounding country,
offering one of the most magnificent panoramas
of sea and land to be seen anywhere on the earth’s
surface. Its name is a compound of two Indian
words, <i>tamal</i> (bay), and <i>pais</i> (mountain). The
resemblance of the latter word to the Spanish
<i>pais</i> (country), is thought by ethnologists to be
purely accidental.</p>

<p>Dr. Vallejo has an explanation of the meaning
of this word which differs somewhat from the one
given by ethnologists. He says it was originally
called <i>Temel-pa</i> (near the sea), and was corrupted
into its present form by the Spaniards. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to Dr. Vallejo, the suffix <i>pa</i> signifies nearness.
(<i>Memoirs of the Vallejos</i>, edited by James H.
Wilkins, San Francisco Bulletin, January, 1914.)</p>

<p>A very remarkable circumstance in the history
of this mountain is the fact that it underwent a
change of position at the time of the great earthquake
of 1906, of course in conjunction with the
entire sheet of the earth’s surface upon which it
stands. On that occasion, the northeast and
southwest sides of the rift slipped upon each
other, first carrying the sheet of land upon which
Tamalpais rests to the north, then the “springback”
carried it back toward the south again.
According to the report of the State Earthquake
Investigation Commission, “As a consequence
of the movement, it is probable that the latitudes
and longitudes of all points in the Coast Ranges
have been permanently changed a few feet.”</p>

<p>So the old mountain, sitting in Indian stoicism,
indifferent to the storms that sometimes lash its
sturdy sides, the fogs that roll in a white, billowy
sea around its foot, and earthquakes that shift
its latitude and longitude some feet, has very
appropriately received its name from the language
of the aborigines who once dwelt at its base.</p>

<h3>MOUNT DIABLO</h3>

<p><i>Mount Diablo</i> (devil mountain), is an isolated,
conical peak of the Coast Range, in Contra Costa
County, about thirty-eight miles northeast of
San Francisco. It rises 3849 feet above the level
of the sea, and is the most conspicuous land-mark
in the central part of the state. General M. G.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Vallejo tells the following story to account for
the name: “In 1806, a military expedition from
San Francisco marched against a tribe called the
Bolgones, who were encamped at the foot of the
mountain. There was a hot fight, which was won
by the Indians. Near the end of the fight, a
person, decorated with remarkable plumage, and
making strange movements, suddenly appeared.
After the victory, the person, called <i>Puy</i> (evil
spirit), in the Indian tongue, departed toward
the mountain. The soldiers heard that this spirit
often appeared thus, and they named the mountain
<i>Diablo</i> (devil). These appearances continued
until the tribe was subdued by Lieutenant
Moraga, in the same year.”</p>

<p>If this be the true story of the naming of Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Diablo, and there seems to be no good reason to
doubt it, it is quite likely that the <i>Puy</i>, or devil,
was one of the “medicine men” who played upon
the superstitions of the Indians by pretending
to be the “spirit of the mountain.”</p>

<p>It is said by Dr. Vallejo that this mountain
was regarded by the Indians as the home of the
Devil, called in their language <i>Pui</i>, and that the
medicine men claimed to be his agents. (<i>Memoirs
of the Vallejos</i>, edited by James H. Wilkins, San
Francisco Bulletin, January, 1914.)</p>

<h3>SAUSALITO</h3>

<p><i>Sausalito</i> (little willow grove), the diminutive
of <i>sausal</i> (willow grove), or, as formerly and officially
written, <i>Saucelito</i> (little willow, from <i>sauce</i>),
is on the west shore of the bay, in Marin County,
six miles northwest of San Francisco. This is
one of the delightful suburban towns around the
bay, where business men of San Francisco have
their homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<h3>MARIN COUNTY</h3>

<p>Of Marin County, separated from San Francisco
by the Golden Gate, and noted for the
beauty of its scenery, we get the story from
General M. G. Vallejo. It appears that in 1815
or ’16, an exploring party from San Francisco had
a fight with the Licatiut tribe, so-called from a
certain root used by them as food, especially in
the Petaluma Valley. During this fight the chief
was captured and carried to San Francisco, but
afterwards escaped, and kept up constant hostilities
in Petaluma Valley. He was finally converted
to Christianity, and did good service for
the whites as ferryman on the bay, and on account
of his skill in navigating these waters, they called
him <i>El Marinero</i> (the sailor); it is thought that
the name of Marin County is a corruption of
this word. <i>El Marinero</i> died at the mission of
San Rafael in 1834.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h3>TIBURÓN</h3>

<p><i>Tiburón</i> (shark), is on the Marin County shore,
opposite San Francisco. It has been facetiously
suggested that this name may have been derived
from “sharks” of the land variety, but it probably
came from some story connected with those of
the sea.</p>

<h3>SAN RAFAEL</h3>

<p>Even in this land, so prodigal with its flowers
from its northern to its southern borders, San
Rafael, the county-seat of Marin County, fifteen
miles north of San Francisco, is notable for the
exceeding beauty of its gardens, where the lily
and the rose bloom from year’s end to year’s
end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus21">
<img src="images/illus21.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE MISSION OF SAN RAFAEL, FOUNDED IN 1817.</p>
<p class="caption">“ ... where the lily and the rose bloom from year’s end to year’s end.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Its patron, St. Raphael, “is considered the
guardian angel of humanity. He was the herald
who bore to the shepherds the ‘good tidings of
great joy which shall be for all people’, and is
especially the protector of the young, the pilgrim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and the traveler.” The “herald of great
joy” seems peculiarly fitting as the protector of
a place where nature has done so much for the
“joy of living.”</p>

<p>The mission of <i>San Rafael Arcángel</i> (St. Raphael
the Archangel), founded in 1817, has now disappeared,
not a vestige remaining of it.</p>

<p>A spur of the Coast Range in Southern California
bears the name of the <i>San Rafael Mountains</i>.</p>

<h3>BENICIA</h3>

<p><i>Benicia</i> (a surname), is the name of a town in
Solano County, on the north side of Carquínez
Strait, twenty-eight miles northeast of San Francisco.
Its story may best be told in the words of
General Sherman, in the following quotation from
his <i>Memoirs</i>: “We found a solitary adobe house,
occupied by Mr. Hastings and his family, embracing
Dr. Semple, the proprietor of the ferry.
The ferry was a ship’s boat, with a lateen sail,
which could carry six or eight horses. It took us
several days to cross over, and during that time
we got well acquainted with the doctor, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
quite a character. He was about seven feet high.
Foreseeing, as he thought, a great city on the bay
somewhere, he selected Carquínez Straits as its
location, and obtained from General Vallejo title
to a league of land, on condition of building a city
to bear the name of General Vallejo’s wife, Francisca
Benicia. Accordingly, the city was first
called <i>Francisca</i>. At this time, where San Francisco
now is was known as <i>Yerba Buena</i>; now some
of the chief men of that place, knowing the importance
of a name, saw their danger, and so
changed the name to <i>San Francisco</i>. Dr. Semple
was so outraged at their changing the name to
one so nearly like his town that he, in turn,
changed his town’s name to the other name of
Mrs. Vallejo, and <i>Benicia</i> it has been to this
day.”</p>

<h3>LAS PULGAS RANCHO</h3>

<p><i>Las Pulgas Rancho</i> (the fleas ranch), is near
Redwood City. The story of this place, with its
unpleasantly suggestive name, although of little
importance in itself, is told here for the light it
throws upon the manners and customs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
original dwellers in the land. Father Engelhardt,
in his <i>History of the California Missions</i>, describes
their way of living thus: “Their habitations were
primitive, in summer often but a shady spot, or
mere shelter of brush. Their winter quarters consisted
of a flimsy structure of poles fixed in the
ground, and drawn together at the top, at a height
of ten or twelve feet. The poles were interwoven
with small twigs, and the structure then covered
with tules, or tufts of dried grass. In some places
these dwellings were conical in shape, in others
oblong, and their size ranged according to the
number of people. At a distance they resembled
large bee-hives, or small hay-stacks. On one side
there was an opening for a door, at the top another
for smoke. Here the family, including relatives
and friends, huddled around the fire, without
privacy, beds or other furniture. A few baskets,
a stone mortar or two, weapons, some scanty
rags of clothing, food obtained from the hunt, or
seeds, were kept here. All refuse food and bones
were left where they were dropped, giving the
earth floor the appearance of a dog-kennel. Fleas
and other vermin abounded in this mass of filth,
which soon became too offensive even for savages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and they adopted the very simple method of
setting fire to the hut and erecting another.”</p>

<p>After reading this description, we are not surprised
when Father Crespi tells us that, having
arrived at a deserted Indian village, and some of
the soldiers having rashly taken refuge in the huts
for the night, they soon rushed out with cries of
“<i>las pulgas! las pulgas!</i>” (the fleas! the fleas!).
He goes on to say, “for this reason, the soldiers
called it the <i>Ranchería de las Pulgas</i>” (the village
of the fleas), a name borne by the ranch to this
day.</p>

<p>La Perouse, in his <i>Voyage Autour du Monde</i>,
says the padres were never able to change this
form of architecture common to the two Californias.
The Indians said they liked open air,
and that it was convenient, when the fleas became
too numerous, to burn the house and construct
a new one, an argument not without merit.</p>

<h3>POINT LOBOS</h3>

<p><i>Point Lobos</i> (seal point, from <i>lobo marino</i>, sea-wolf),
is just outside of the Golden Gate, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
south side, near the spot where the seals crawling
about on the rocks have long been one of the
chief attractions of the famous Cliff House.</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Álamo</i> (cottonwood tree), is the name of a
place in Contra Costa County, twenty-four miles
northeast of San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>Alvarado</i> (a surname), that of one of the first
governors of the state. Alvarado is a village in
Alameda County, on Alameda Creek, twenty-four
miles southeast of San Francisco. Juan Bautista
Alvarado was a central figure in California history.
He was born at Monterey, February 14, 1809,
and from ’27 on occupied various official positions,
including that of governor of the state. Bancroft
says of his character and appearance: “In
physique Don Juan Bautista was of medium
stature, stout build, fair complexion, and light
hair; of genial temperament, courteous manners,
and rare powers of winning friends. There was
much in his character to praise, much to condemn.
He was a man of dissipated habits, and engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in intrigues, but in his favor it may be said that
he had more brains, energy and executive ability
than any three of his contemporaries combined;
he was patriotic and with good intentions toward
his country, honorable in private dealings, and
never enriched himself by his intrigues. He was
not personally guilty of having plundered the
missions, only responsible through being governor
at that time. The accusations made against him
of an unjust policy towards foreigners were entirely
false.”</p>

<p><i>Bolinas</i>, the name of a town in Marin County,
delightfully situated on Bolinas Bay, eighteen
miles northwest of San Francisco. Bolinas is
probably a corruption of <i>Baulines</i>, an Indian word
of unknown meaning. A land grant called <i>Los
Baulines</i> was located at the same place, and was
probably the name of an Indian village.</p>

<p><i>Point Bonito</i> (pretty point), is the southern
extremity of Marin County, on the north side of
the Golden Gate.</p>

<p><i>Carquínez</i> is the name of the strait flowing
between the counties of Contra Costa and Solano,
and connects San Pablo Bay with Suisún Bay.
The strait is eight miles long, and at its narrowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
part nearly a mile wide. All the waters flowing
through the great central valley of the state from
the Sierra Nevada pass through this strait.
According to the scientists the name <i>Carquínez</i> is
derived from Karkin, the name of an Indian
village in that region, but Dr. Vallejo has another
story. He says the commandant at Monterey,
who was a man with some classical education,
named it from the Greek word <i>karkin</i>,
crab, because of the report made by the Lieutenant
Vallejo expedition of having found a great number
of little crabs there. (<i>Memoirs of the Vallejos</i>,
edited by James H. Wilkins, San Francisco Bulletin,
January, 1914.)</p>

<p><i>Contra Costa</i> (opposite coast), so-called on account
of its original position directly opposite San
Francisco. It should be explained that the name
Contra Costa, which scarcely seems appropriate
in its present application, was originally applied
to the whole of the coast opposite San Francisco.
Afterwards the part directly facing San Francisco
was cut off to form Alameda County, thus destroying
the significance of the name Contra Costa.</p>

<p><i>Martínez</i> (a surname), is the name of the county-seat
of Contra Costa County, and is on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
shore of Suisún Bay, thirty-six miles northeast of
San Francisco. Ignacio Martínez was a native
of the city of Mexico, born in 1771. He was a
military officer under the Mexican government in
California, and was <i>commandante</i> at San Francisco
from 1822 to ’27. Bancroft says of him:
“He was not popular as an officer, being haughty
and despotic, but as a rancher he is spoken of as
a very courteous and hospitable man. The town
of Martínez takes its name from him or his
family.”</p>

<p><i>Montara Point</i> and Montara Mountains are in
the western part of San Matéo County. Montara
is a surname.</p>

<p><i>Olema</i>, said to be an Indian word meaning
“coyote,” is the name of a town in Marin County,
one mile from the head of Tomales Bay, and
thirty-five miles northwest of San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>Pacheco</i> (a surname), that of a pioneer family
of California. The town of Pacheco is in Contra
Costa County, thirty miles northeast of San
Francisco. Although Governor Romualdo
Pacheco, of whom Bancroft says that “his record
as a citizen, in respect of character, attainments
and social standing was a good one,” was the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
prominent member of the family, the town was
not named in his honor, but for Salvio Pacheco,
a man who served in many military and civil
offices. “He spent his life on Mount Diablo
Rancho, on which is the town bearing his name.”</p>

<p><i>Pescadero</i> (fishing place), is in a fertile valley
of San Matéo County, on the coast about forty-four
miles south of San Francisco. There are a
number of <i>Pescaderos</i> in the state.</p>

<p><i>Pinole</i> is said to be an Aztec word, applied to
any kind of grain or seeds, parched and ground.
Of this flour a very appetizing sort of gruel was
made. The town of Pinole is in Contra Costa
County, twelve miles west of Martínez. It is the
site of extensive powder works. See page <a href="#Page_239">239.</a></p>

<p><i>Portolá</i> (a surname), is the name of a town in
San Matéo County, and was named in honor of
the celebrated discoverer of San Francisco Bay.</p>

<p><i>Potrero</i> (pasture ground), is one of the districts
of San Francisco. This is only one of the many
<i>Potreros</i> in the state.</p>

<p><i>Presidio</i> is a word used by the Spaniards in the
double meaning of prison or military post. It
may be that the custom of using convicts as
soldiers, prevalent with the Spanish, had something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to do with this double usage of the word. The
Presidio of San Francisco, now a regular military
post of the United States, although still retaining
its Castilian name, is picturesquely and delightfully
situated on the north end of the peninsula.
There is also a government presidio at Monterey.</p>

<p><i>Point Reyes</i> (kings point), was named by Vizcaíno
in honor of the “three wise men,” or “holy
kings,” because it was discovered on the day of
their devotion. This point is in Marin County
and is the outer point of Drake’s Bay, where the
noted adventurer is supposed to have made his
anchorage, and where Cermeñón was wrecked.</p>

<p><i>Rodéo</i> (round-up of cattle). Rodéos were held,
and in some parts of the state still take place, for
the purpose of separating and branding the cattle
belonging to individual owners, an operation
decidedly necessary when pastures were unfenced,
and in early days one of the most picturesque
features of California life. The village of Rodéo
is in Contra Costa County.</p>

<p><i>San Anselmo</i> (St. Anselm), is in Marin County.</p>

<p><i>San Bruno</i>, a village near San Francisco, was
named for St. Bruno, the founder and first abbot
of the Carthusian Order. This order of monks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
is among the most severe in its rules, requiring
almost perpetual silence of its members. Its
devotees are only permitted to speak together
once a week. They never eat flesh, and are compelled
to labor constantly.</p>

<p><i>San Gerónimo</i> (St. Jerome), is the saint usually
pictured as accompanied by a lion, in commemoration
of the well-known story of the removal of a
thorn from the foot of one of those beasts by
Jerome, and the devotion of the lion to him afterwards.
San Gerónimo is the name of a small
stream in Marin County, noted for its salmon
fisheries.</p>

<p><i>San Gregorio</i> (St. Gregory), is in San Matéo
County, twenty-four miles southwest of Redwood
City. St. Gregory was a noble Roman who devoted
his wealth to charity, and turned his home into a
hospital and monastery. He was elected to the
high office of Pope, and became the composer
of what is called from him the “Gregorian Chant.”</p>

<p><i>San Leandro</i> (St. Leander), is in Alameda
County, on San Leandro Creek, sixteen miles
southeast of San Francisco. St. Leander was at
one time Bishop of Seville, and is one of the patron
saints of that city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p><i>San Lorenzo</i> (St. Lawrence), was a saint who
suffered martyrdom by being roasted on a gridiron.
The legend relates that he said to his tormentors,
“I am now sufficiently cooked on this side, turn
me over and roast me on the other.” San Lorenzo
is in Alameda County, twenty miles southeast of
San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>San Matéo</i> (St. Matthew), is the name of a
county bordering on San Francisco Bay, and of a
town on the west shore of the bay, twenty-one
miles south of San Francisco. St. Matthew was a
Hebrew by birth, and the author of the book of
the Scriptures that bears his name.</p>

<p><i>San Pablo</i> (St. Paul), is in Contra Costa County,
on San Pablo Bay, fifteen miles northeast of San
Francisco. One of the legends concerning St.
Paul is that “the church called ‘San Paolo delle
Tre Fontane,’ near Rome, is built over three
fountains which are said to have sprung up at
the three places where the head of St. Paul fell
and bounded, after being cut off by the executioner.
It is said that the fountains vary in the
warmth of the water,—the first, or the one where
the head fell, being the hottest; the next, or that
of the first bound, cooler; and the third still cooler.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p><i>San Quentin</i> (properly San Quintín) is a village
in Marin County, on the west shore of San Francisco
Bay, eleven miles north of San Francisco.
This place, where the forbidding walls of the
State’s Prison shut out the light of California’s
glorious sun from the unfortunates enclosed there,
very fittingly bears the name of a saint whose
gloomy story runs thus: “San Quintín was the
son of Zeno. He became converted and gave up a
high command which he held in the Roman army,
in order to preach. He labored especially in
Belgium, and suffered death by being impaled
on an iron spit.”—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>) It is
probable, however, that the town was not directly
named for this saint, but received the name indirectly
from Point Quintín, on the Marin coast,
which was so-called from an Indian chief of that
region who had been thus christened by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>San Ramón</i> (St. Raymond), is in Contra Costa
County, nine miles east of Haywood. “St. Raymond
belonged to the Order of Mercy, and
labored for the captives among the Moors. By
the Mahometans, among whom he was long a
captive, for the ransom of his Christian brethren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his lips were bored through with a red-hot iron,
and fastened with a padlock,” an effective, if
cruel method of preventing him from preaching
the Christian faith.</p>

<p><i>Suñol</i> (a surname). Suñol is a town in Alameda
County, thirty-six miles southeast of San Francisco.
In Fremont’s <i>Memoirs</i> he refers to Don
Antonio Suñol, probably a member of the same
family for whom this town is named.</p>

<p><i>Tocaloma</i> is a delightful secluded glen and creek
in Marin County, not far north of San Francisco,
where a hunting and fishing preserve is maintained.
The word is Indian, but its meaning has
not been ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Tomales Bay</i> is an inlet of the Pacific Ocean,
extending southeastward into Marin County.
It is fourteen miles long. The village of Tomales
is on the bay of the same name, fifty-five miles
northwest of San Francisco. The name <i>Tomales</i>
is a Spanish corruption of the Indian <i>tamal</i> (bay),
a word which came to be applied to the natives
in the neighborhood of San Francisco Bay.</p>

<p><i>Vallejo</i> (a surname), is the name of a place in
Solano County. The Vallejos were among the most
prominent of the California pioneer families.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“The founder of the family was Ignacio Vicente
Ferrer Vallejo, born at Jalisco, Mexico, in 1748.
He came of a family of pure Spanish blood, and of
superior education. The most distinguished of
his large family was Mariano Guadalupe, born
at Monterey in 1808. Don Mariano served with
great ability in various capacities under the
Mexican government, and was at one time <i>Commandante
General</i> of California. He was the
founder of Sonoma, and it was to his untiring
efforts that the development of the north was
largely due. He foresaw the fate of his country,
and finally cast in his lot with the United States,
for which he seems to have been but ill-repaid.
I have found none among the Californians whose
public record in respect of honorable conduct,
patriotic zeal, executive ability, and freedom from
petty prejudices of race or religion or sectional
politics is more evenly favorable than his.”—(Bancroft.)</p>

<h3>SONOMA</h3>

<p><i>Sonoma</i>, the name of the northern county, and
of the town in the beautiful Sonoma Valley,
forty-five miles north of San Francisco, is of
doubtful origin. It is probable that it comes from
Indian, rather than Spanish sources. In the
native dialect of that region there is the constantly
recurring ending <i>tso-noma</i>, from <i>tso</i> (the
earth), and <i>noma</i> (village), hence, <i>tsonoma</i>
(earth village or earth place). The name was
given by missionaries to a chief of the Indians
there, and later applied to all the Indians at the
mission. From Indian sources it seems there was
a captain among them who was commonly called
<i>Sonoma</i>, but who was known by a different name
among his own people.—(University of California
Publications in American Archaeology and
Technology.)</p>

<p>The name Sonoma is explained in a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
way by Dr. Vallejo, who says it was named for
an Indian chief called <i>Sono</i>, a word signifying
“nose,” given to the chief as his appellation because
of the very large development of that
feature of his face. The suffix <i>ma</i> is said by Dr.
Vallejo to mean “valley” or “land,” and thus
Sonoma would bear the meaning of “nose valley,”
or “nose land,”—(<i>Memoirs of the Vallejos</i>, edited
by James H. Wilkins, San Francisco Bulletin,
January, 1914.)</p>

<p>It has been said that Sonoma means “valley
of the moon,” in reference to the shape of the
valley, but there is probably more of poetry than
of truth in this story.</p>

<p>At this place, <i>San Francisco de Solano</i>, the last
of the great chain of missions, was founded
July 4, 1823. The mission buildings have been
put in a fair state of preservation and the church
has been restored by the state.</p>

<h3>NAPA</h3>

<p><i>Napa</i> is the name of a county, river and city,
the county adjacent to San Pablo Bay, into which
the river falls. The town is the county-seat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Napa County, and is on the river of the same name,
about thirty-nine miles northeast of San Francisco.
The Napa Soda Springs are an interesting
natural feature of this place.</p>

<p><i>Napa</i>, accented in some of the old documents
as <i>Napá</i>, was the name of an Indian tribe who
occupied that valley, said to have been one of the
bravest of the California tribes, and who constantly
harassed the frontier posts. The entire
tribe was practically wiped out by smallpox in
1838.</p>

<p>According to S. A. Barrett, in the University
of California Publications in American Archaeology
and Technology, there is a Pomo Indian
word, <i>napa</i>, meaning “harpoon point,” between
which and the name of the town of Napa there
may be some connection.</p>

<p>Dr. Vallejo says the suffix <i>pa</i> signifies proximity,
and that Napa means “near mother,” or
“near home,” or “mother-land,” and that according
to tradition Napa Valley was the cradle of the
Suysun race.—(<i>Memoirs of the Vallejos</i>, edited
by James H. Wilkins, San Francisco Bulletin,
January, 1914.)</p>

<h3>CARNE HUMANA</h3>

<p>Among the names of the old Spanish land
grants are many that hold a suggestion of interesting
and sometimes tragic tales, now lost in the
dim shadows of the past. Of such is <i>Carne
Humana</i> (human flesh), the name of a grant in
Napa County, near St. Helena. This spot may
have been the scene of one of those horrible acts
of cannibalism to which the Indians of the entire
Southwest were quite generally addicted. Captain
Fages, in his diary of one of the expeditions
to San Francisco Bay, mentions that this practice
prevailed among the Indians of that region to a
certain extent, but seems to have been confined
to the eating of the bodies of enemies slain in
battle, and only the relatives of the slayer were
permitted to take part in the abhorrent feast.</p>

<h3>SANTA ROSA</h3>

<p><i>Santa Rosa</i> (St. Rose), the county-seat of
Sonoma County, is fifty-seven miles northwest of
San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting story is told of Santa Rosa de
Lima, said to be the only canonized female saint
of the New World. She was born at Lima, in
Peru, and was distinguished for her hatred of
vanity, and her great austerity, carrying these
characteristics to such an extreme that she destroyed
her beautiful complexion with a compound
of pepper and quicklime. When her mother
commanded her to wear a wreath of roses, she so
arranged it that it was in truth a crown of thorns.
Her food consisted principally of bitter herbs, and
she maintained her parents by her labor, working
all day in her garden and all night with her needle.
The legend relates that when Pope Clement X
was asked to canonize her, he refused, exclaiming:
“<i>India y Santa! Asi como llueven rosas!</i>” (An
Indian woman a saint! That may happen when
it rains roses!) Instantly a shower of roses began
to fall in the Vatican, and did not cease until the
Pope was convinced of his error. This saint is the
patroness of America, and is represented as wearing
a thorny crown, and holding in her hand the
figure of the infant Jesus, which rests on full-blown
roses.—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<h3>MENDOCINO COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Mendocino County</i>, in the northwestern part of
the state, is distinguished for its extensive forests
of redwoods. The main belt of these trees
extends through this county, and they may here
be seen in their highest development. They vary
in height from 100 to 340 feet, and reach a diameter
of from two to sixteen feet, having a red,
fibrous bark sometimes a foot in thickness. Notwithstanding
their great size, the delicacy of their
foliage, which takes the form of flat sprays, gives
them a graceful, fern-like appearance. The age
of mature redwoods is said to range from 500 to
1300 years. The special characteristics of the
wood of these trees are, its durability when buried
in the soil, and its resistance to fire. Commercially
it is valuable for many purposes, being preferred
to steel for water supply conduits, and, in
the form of saw-dust, found to be better than
cork for packing fresh grapes.—(Notes from <i>The
Trees of California</i>, by Professor Willis Linn
Jepsen, of the University of California.)</p>

<p>Probably the first written mention of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
trees occurs in the diary of Gaspar de Portolá, the
discoverer of San Francisco Bay, whose attention
was attracted to them while on his way up the
coast, and from whom they received the name of
<i>palo colorado</i> (redwood). Altogether, the credit
of their discovery seems to belong to Portolá,
although it has been given by some persons to
Archibald Menzies, who wrote a description of
the trees in 1795.</p>

<p>The village of Mendocino is on the coast, about
130 miles northwest of San Francisco. The name
was first applied to the cape, which was discovered
by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, in 1542, and named
by him for Don Antonio de Mendoza, first viceroy
of New Spain.</p>

<h3>KLAMATH</h3>

<p><i>Klamath</i> is the name of a village in Humboldt
County, but is particularly known as applied to
the Klamath River, which flows in a deep and
narrow canyon through the counties of Siskiyou
and Humboldt.</p>

<p>The word, in its different forms of <i>Klamath</i>,
<i>Tlametl</i>, and <i>Clamet</i>, is the name by which these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Indians were known to the Chinooks, and through
them to the whites, their proper designation in
their own language being <i>Lutuami</i>.—(Bancroft’s
<i>Native Races</i>, Vol. 1, page 444.)</p>

<p>The meaning of the word has not been positively
ascertained, although it is thought by
ethnologists to be a possible corruption of <i>Maklaks</i>
(people, community,—literally, the encamped).
The Klamaths were a hardy people, who had
many slaves captured from other tribes. The
slave trade seems to have been carried on quite
extensively among the California Indians.</p>

<h3>MODOC COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Modoc</i>, the county in the northeastern corner
of the state, is notable as having been the home
of the only California tribe that ever caused
serious trouble to the United States Government.
The Modoc wars are a matter of history.</p>

<p>The Modocs were a fierce tribe of Indians who
lived at the head-waters of Pit River, and the
name is thought by some persons to mean “head
of the river,” or “people, community,” but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
ethnologists are of the opinion that it means
“south people,” probably used by tribes living
north of the Modocs. Bancroft, quoting from
Steele, in Indian Affairs Report of 1864, page 121,
says: “The word <i>Modoc</i> is a Shasta Indian word,
and means all distant, stranger, or hostile Indians,
and became applied to this tribe by white men in
early days from hearing the Shastas refer to them
by this term.” It does not appear that Bancroft
had any genuine scientific authority for this
statement.</p>

<p>Powers, in his <i>Tribes of California</i>, states that
some persons derive this name from <i>Mo-dok-us</i>,
the name of a former chief of the tribe under
whose leadership they seceded from the Klamath
Lake Indians and became an independent
tribe. As it was common for seceding bands to
assume the name of their leader, Powers is inclined
to accept this explanation of the name.</p>

<h3>SHASTA</h3>

<p>To account for the name <i>Shasta</i>, a number of
theories have been advanced, no one of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
seems to be positively established. According
to the Bureau of Ethnology, “Shasta may be a
corruption of <i>Sus-tí-ka</i>, apparently the name of a
well-known Indian living about 1840 near the
site of Yreka. The name was applied to a group
of small tribes in Northern California, extending
into Oregon, who were soon extinguished by the
development of mining operations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus23">

<p class="caption">MOUNT SHASTA.</p>
<p class="caption">“ ... its summit glistening with snow and visible at a distance of 140 miles down the valley.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Bancroft, in his <i>Native Races</i>, says, “Shasta
was apparently the name of a tribe living about
1840 near Yreka, a tribe made up of several
groups. They were a sedentary people, living in
small houses, similar to those in use by the Indians
on the coast immediately to the west. Their food
was made up of acorns, seeds, roots, and fish,
particularly salmon. The salmon was caught by
net, weir, trap, and spear. Their arts were few.
They had dug-out canoes of a rather broad,
clumsy type. The bow was their chief weapon,
and their carving was limited to rude spoons of
wood and bone. Painting was little used, and
basketry was limited to basket caps for the
women, and small food baskets of simple form.
The tribe soon succumbed to the unfavorable
environment of the mining camp, and is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
almost extinct.... The Shasta Indians
were known in their own language as <i>Weohow</i>,
a word meaning ‘stone house,’ from the large
cave in their country.”</p>

<p>“<i>Shas-ti-ka</i> was probably the tribal name of
the Shasta Indians. <i>Wai-re-ka</i> (mountain) was
their name for Mt. Shasta.”—(Powers’ <i>Tribes of
California</i>.)</p>

<p>Another theory advanced is that Shasta is a
corruption of the Russian word <i>tchastal</i>, (white,
or pure mountain), and still another that it comes
from the French <i>chaste</i>, (pure), but it is likely
that its resemblance to these words is purely
accidental, and that its origin is Indian.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the derivation of its name,
there is no question that Mount Shasta, with its
snow-capped summit, has but few rivals for
scenic beauty among its mountain sisterhood.
It is an extinct volcano, with a double peak, and
rises to a height of 14380 feet. There are minor
glaciers on the northern slope. Fremont says of
it: “The Shastl peak stands at the head of the
lower valley, rising from a base of about one
thousand feet, out of a forest of heavy timber.
It ascends like an immense column upwards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
14000 feet (nearly the height of Mont Blanc),
the summit glistening with snow, and visible,
from favorable points of view, at a distance of 140
miles down the valley.”</p>

<p>On a United States map of date of 1848, drawn
by Charles Preuss from surveys made by Fremont
and other persons, the name appears spelled as
<i>Tshastl</i>.</p>

<p>Mount Shasta is in Siskiyou County, and is
the most conspicuous natural feature in that
part of the state.</p>

<h3>SISKIYOU COUNTY</h3>

<p>Except that it is of Indian origin, nothing
authentic has been obtained concerning <i>Siskiyou</i>,
the name of the county in the extreme north of
the state. Several popular theories have been
advanced, one to the effect that Siskiyou means
“lame horse.” If that be true the word must have
been introduced into the Indian language after
the coming of the Spaniards, since horses were
unknown to the Indians before that period.
Another story, perhaps more pleasing than true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
runs as follows: “On the summit of a mountain
in Oregon, just over the divide, there is a beautiful,
level spot, watered by cool springs, which overlooks
the country for miles around. Here the
powerful Shasta, Rogue River, and Klamath
tribes used to meet to smoke and indulge in dancing
and games. They called the place <i>Sis-ki-you</i>,
the ‘council ground’.”</p>

<p>Siskiyou County is notable for its mountain
scenery, and includes within its borders the
famous Mount Shasta.</p>

<h3>TRINITY COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Trinity County</i> received its name from Trinidad
Bay, which was discovered and named by Captain
Bruno Ezeta, on Trinity Sunday, in the year
1775. Trinidad is the Spanish word meaning
Trinity.</p>

<p>Trinity River was so-named through the mistaken
belief that it emptied into Trinidad Bay.</p>

<p>Trinidad is also the name of a village in Humboldt
County, on the ocean shore, twenty miles
north of Eureka.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<h3>YREKA</h3>

<p><i>Yreka</i>, the name of the county-seat of Siskiyou
County, is an Indian word, of which the spelling
has probably been corrupted, perhaps in a spirit
of facetiousness, from the original <i>Wai-ri-ka</i> to its
present eccentric form. Various theories have been
offered in explanation of the word, but the only
one apparently based on scientific data seems to
be that it means “north place.” One writer
advances the whimsical explanation that the word
was formed by the transposition of the letters
in “bakery,” but fails to explain what becomes of
the letter “b.” This is, of course, but an idle
invention.</p>

<p><i>Yreka</i> is said by Powers, in his <i>Tribes of California</i>,
to be the Indian word for “mountain,”
especially applied to Mt. Shasta. Its former
spelling was <i>Wai-ri-ka</i>. Here is a contradiction
between scientists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Agua Caliente</i> (hot water, hot springs), a village
in Sonoma County, forty-five miles north of San
Francisco.</p>

<p><i>Altúras</i> (heights), the county-seat of Modoc
County, 110 miles north of Reno.</p>

<p><i>Point Arena</i> (sandy point), is the name of the
cape on the Mendocino coast, and of the village in
that county, 110 miles northwest of San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>Bodega</i> (a surname), that of its discoverer, Don
Juan de la Bodega y Quadra, Captain of the
schooner Sonora, who sailed into Bodega Bay
October 3, 1775. This bay, and the town of
Bodega Roads are in Sonoma County, about
sixty-four miles northwest of San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>Point Cabrillo</i> (a surname), that of the celebrated
Spanish explorer, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo.</p>

<p><i>Calistoga</i>, one of those hybrid words of which
California has too many. This word was the
invention of Samuel Brannan, an early settler,
and is compounded of the first syllable of California
and the last of Saratoga. It is given here
lest it be mistaken for Indian or Spanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cazadero</i> (hunting-place).</p>

<p><i>Chileno</i> (Chilean, native of Chile).</p>

<p><i>Punta Delgada</i> (thin or narrow point). See
<i>Punta Gorda</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cape Fortunas</i> (cape fortunes). Fortuna is a
village in Humboldt County, twelve miles south
of Eureka.</p>

<p><i>Del Norte</i> (of the north), is the name of the
county in the extreme northwestern corner of the
state.</p>

<p><i>García</i> (a surname), the name of a creek in
Mendocino County.</p>

<p><i>Punta Gorda</i> (thick or broad point). Punta
Gorda and Punta Delgada are adjacent points
on the northern coast whose contrast in shape is
indicated by their names. See <i>Punta Delgada</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gualala</i>, a village in Mendocino County, forty
miles west of Cloverdale. This is an Indian word,
“probably from <i>walali</i>, a generic term of the Pomo
language, signifying the meeting-place of the
waters of any in-flowing stream with those of the
stream into which it flows, or with the ocean.
The present spelling is probably influenced by
the Spanish.”—(S. A. Barrett, in California Publications
of Archaeology and Ethnology.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hoopa</i>, a village in Humboldt County, on the
Trinity River, was named for the Hupa Indians,
a tribe on the lower Trinity River. Hoopa
Mountain was named in the same way.</p>

<p><i>Point Laguna</i> (lagoon point).</p>

<p><i>Oro Fino</i> (fine gold), is the name of a village in
Siskiyou County, twenty-five miles southwest of
Yreka. This name is in contrast to the place
called <i>Oro Grande</i> (coarse gold), in the southern
part of the state.</p>

<p><i>Petaluma</i>, the name of a town in Sonoma
County, forty-two miles northwest of San Francisco.
Petaluma was the name of an Indian
village situated near the site of the present town
on a low hill, and according to S. A. Barrett
the word is compounded of <i>peta</i> (flat), and
<i>luma</i> (back), making <i>Petaluma</i> (flat back), but
Dr. Vallejo has another explanation of its meaning.
He holds that the suffix <i>ma</i> means “valley”
or “land,” and that Petaluma is a combination
of three Suysun words, <i>Pe-talu-ma</i>, signifying
“Oh! fair valley,” or “Oh! fair land.”—(<i>Memoirs
of the Vallejos</i>, edited by James H. Wilkins, San
Francisco Bulletin, January, 1914.)</p>

<p><i>Pomo</i> is northeast of Ukiah. “Pomo was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Indian village on the east bank of the Russian
River, in the southern end of Potter Valley, a
short distance south of the post-office at Pomo.
The word is an ending, meaning ‘people of, village
of’.”—(S. A. Barrett.)</p>

<p><i>Tomales Bay</i> is just north of Drake’s Bay, in
Marin County. The word is a Spanish corruption
of the Indian <i>tamal</i> (bay).</p>

<p><i>Ukiah</i> is the county-seat of Mendocino County,
and is on the Russian River, 110 miles northwest
of San Francisco. “The word is said to be derived
from the Indian <i>yokaia</i>, <i>yo</i> (south), and <i>ka-ia</i>
(valley), the name of a village about six miles
southeast of the present town of Ukiah.”</p>

<h3>TEHAMA COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Tehama County</i> lies at the extreme northern
end of the great Central Valley of the state.
There is a village of the same name in the county,
on the Sacramento River, twelve miles southeast
of Red Bluff.</p>

<p>The name <i>Tehama</i> was derived from an Indian
tribe, but the meaning of it has not been ascertained.
Two definitions have been offered,—“high
water,” in reference to the overflowing of
the Sacramento River, and “low land,” but these
may be among those attempts to account for our
names by making the name fit the circumstances,
a method which has resulted in many errors. All
that can be positively stated is that the word is
of Indian origin.</p>

<h3>COLUSA</h3>

<p><i>Colusa</i> is a county in the northern part of the
Central Valley, and has a county-seat of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
name, situated on the west bank of the Sacramento
River, sixty-five miles northwest of Sacramento.</p>

<p>This name appears as <i>Colus</i> on the land grant
located at that place, and is said by Powers, in
his <i>Tribes of California</i>, to be a corruption of
<i>Ko-ru-si</i>, a tribal name, a more reasonable explanation
than any other that has been offered.
General Will Green, said to have known the tribe
well, was of the opinion that Colusa meant “the
scratchers,” in allusion to a strange custom among
these people of scratching one another’s faces.
While it is true that the prevalence of this custom
is mentioned by the Spaniards, Captain Fages
referring to it in terms of great distaste, there is
no scientific corroboration of that definition for
the word <i>Colusa</i>.</p>

<h3>YUBA</h3>

<p><i>Yuba</i> is the name of a county in the Central
Valley, of Yuba City, the county-seat of Sutter
County, and of the Yuba River, which is formed
by the union of three branches rising in the Sierra
Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The name <i>Yuba</i> was first applied to the river,
the chief tributary of the Feather. The theory
has been advanced that it received the name of
<i>Uba</i>, or <i>Uva</i>, the Spanish word for grapes, from
an exploring party in 1824, in reference to the
immense quantities of vines loaded with wild
grapes growing along its banks, <i>Uba</i>, becoming
corrupted into <i>Yuba</i>, but Powers, in his <i>Tribes of
California</i>, says Yuba is derived from a tribe of
Maidu Indians named <i>Yu-ba</i>, who lived on the
Feather River. This is probably the true explanation
of the name. It is to be noted that Fremont,
in his <i>Memoirs</i>, speaks of it as Indian: “We
traveled across the valley plain, and in about
sixteen miles reached Feather River, at twenty
miles from its junction with the Sacramento, near
the mouth of the Yuba, so-called from a village of
Indians who live on it. The Indians aided us
across the river with canoes and small rafts. Extending
along the bank in front of the village
was a range of wicker cribs, about twelve feet
high, partly filled with what is there the Indians’
staff of life, acorns. A collection of huts, shaped
like bee-hives, with naked Indians sunning
themselves on the tops, and these acorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
cribs, are the prominent objects in an Indian
village.”</p>

<h3>YOLO</h3>

<p><i>Yolo</i> is the name of a county in the northern
part of the Central Valley, and of a village near
Woodland.</p>

<p><i>Yolo</i>, or <i>Yoloy</i>, was the name of a Patwin tribe,
and the word is said by the Bureau of Ethnology
to mean “a place abounding with rushes.”</p>

<p>In 1884 there were still forty-five of the tribe
living in Yolo County.</p>

<h3>SOLANO</h3>

<p>This county, situated in the Central Valley,
immediately northeast of San Francisco, was
named, at the request of General Mariano Vallejo,
in honor of an Indian chief of the Suisunes who
had aided him in war against the other natives.
The name of this chief in his own tongue is said
to have been <i>Sem Yeto</i>, “the Fierce one of the
Brave Hand,” or <i>Sum-yet-ho</i>, “the Mighty Arm,”
and, judging by the description given of him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Dr. Vallejo, he must have been a living refutation
of the common belief that the California Indians
were invariably squat and ill-formed, for he was
a splendid figure of a man, six feet, seven inches
in height and large in proportion. He was converted
to Christianity and received the name of
the celebrated missionary, Francisco Solano, as
well as a grant of land containing 17752 acres,
known as the Suisún Grant.</p>

<h3>SUISÚN</h3>

<p><i>Suisún Bay</i> is a body of navigable water connected
with San Pablo Bay by the Carquínez
Strait, and is the outlet of the San Joaquín and
Sacramento Rivers. Suisún City is in Solano
County, on a slough, about fifty miles northeast
of San Francisco. Suisún was the name of an
Indian village on that bay, and the word is said
by some persons to mean a “big expanse.” The
name was probably first given to the land grant.</p>

<p>This region was the home of an important tribe
of Indians who had an interesting and tragic
history. Their religious capital, if such it could
be called, was at Napa, near which place there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
a certain stone from which they believed one of
their gods had ascended into upper air, leaving
the impress of his foot upon the stone. General
Vallejo says that in 1817 a military expedition
under command of Lieutenant José Sánchez
crossed the straits of Carquínez on rafts, for the
double purpose of exploring the country and reducing
it to Christianity. “On crossing the river
they were attacked by the Suisún tribe, headed
by their chief Malaca, and the Spaniards suffered
considerable loss; the Indians fought bravely,
but were forced to retire to their <i>ranchería</i>, where,
being hotly pursued, and believing their fate
sealed, these unfortunate people, incited by their
chief, set fire to their own rush-built huts, and
perished in the flames with their families. The
soldiers endeavored to stay their desperate resolution,
in order to save the women and children,
but they preferred this doom to that which they
believed to await them at the hands of their
enemies.” The Suisún tribe is now entirely extinct,
a large number having been carried off by
a frightful epidemic of smallpox. Dr. Vallejo
states that this tribe, a people described by him as
possessing many attractive qualities, was estimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
by his father to number at least 40,000
persons in 1835. After the great epidemic, which
was brought down by the Russians from the
north, and which lasted during the three consecutive
years of 1837-38-39, there were barely two
hundred left. Thus the disappearance of the
California Indians was occasioned, not by the
white man’s bullets or fire-water, nor even by the
deteriorating influence of a changed mode of
living, nor by the loss of native sturdiness through
an acquired dependence upon the church, but
suddenly and fearfully by the introduction of
the hideous diseases of civilization.</p>

<h3>SACRAMENTO</h3>

<p><i>Sacramento County</i> and the city of the same
name, the state capital, situated near the center
of the Great Valley, received their names from
the river, which, following the usual custom of the
Spaniards, was christened first, being named in
honor of the Holy Sacrament.</p>

<p>Captain Moraga first gave the name of <i>Jesús
María</i> to the main river, calling the branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
<i>Sacramento</i>, but later the main stream became
known as <i>Sacramento</i>, and the branch as <i>El Río
de las Plumas</i> (the river of the feathers).</p>

<h3>COSUMNE</h3>

<p><i>Cosumne</i> is the name of a village in Sacramento
County, about twenty-two miles southeast of
Sacramento. The Cosumne river rises in El
Dorado County, near the Sierra Nevada, and
enters the Mokelumne about twenty-five miles
south of the city of Sacramento.</p>

<p><i>Cosumne</i> is an Indian word, said to mean
“salmon,” and was taken from the tribe who lived
upon the river. The frequent occurrence of the
ending <i>amni</i>, or <i>umne</i>, in the names of rivers in
the Sierras has led to the mistaken conclusion
that the suffix actually means “river,” but we
have the statement of A. L. Kroeber, Professor
of Anthropology in the University of California,
that, “The supposition may be hazarded that the
ending <i>amni</i>, or <i>umne</i>, is originally a Miwok
ending, with the meaning ‘people of’.” Thus the
meaning of Cosumne may be “people of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
village of Coso,” and of Mokelumne, “people of
the village of Mukkel,” and so on through all the
names having this ending.</p>

<p>Powers, in his <i>Tribes of California</i>, says <i>Kos-sum-mi</i>
was the Indian word for “salmon,” and that
this is the probable origin of the name Cosumne.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Ethnology has an interesting
paragraph on the manners and customs of these
Indians: “They went almost naked; their houses
were of bark, sometimes thatched with grass, and
covered with earth; the bark was loosened from
the trees by repeated blows with stone hatchets,
the latter having the head fastened to the handle
with deer sinews. Their ordinary weapons were
bows and stone-tipped arrows. The women made
finely-woven conical baskets of grass, the smaller
ones of which held water. Their amusements
were chiefly dancing and foot-ball; the dances,
however, were in some degree ceremonial. Their
principal deity was the sun, and the women had a
ceremony which resembled the ‘sun dance’ of
the tribes of the upper Missouri. Their dead were
buried in graves in the earth. The tribe is now
practically extinct.”—(quoted from Rice, in
<i>American Anthropology</i>, III, 259, 1890.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<h3>SAN JOAQUÍN</h3>

<p><i>San Joaquín County</i>, famous for its vast fields
of wheat, is a part of the great Central Valley,
and the river of the same name rises in the Sierras,
flows north-northwest through the valley and
unites with the Sacramento River near its mouth.</p>

<p>The river was named in honor of St. Joachim,
the father of the Virgin. Lieutenant Moraga
first gave the name to a rivulet which springs
from the Sierra Nevada, and empties into Lake
Buena Vista. The river derived its name from
this rivulet.</p>

<p>The rich valley of the San Joaquín, two hundred
miles long and thirty miles wide, with its wide, treeless
expanses where the wild grasses grew rankly,
was once a paradise for game. Fremont says:
“Descending the valley we traveled among multitudinous
herds of elk, antelope, and wild horses.
Several of the latter which we killed for food were
found to be very fat.” Herds of wild horses still
range in California and Nevada, and are sometimes
captured for sale, fine specimens bringing
high prices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<h3>STANISLAUS</h3>

<p><i>Stanislaus</i> is the name of the county just south
of San Joaquín, and of one of the tributaries of
the San Joaquín River.</p>

<p>The word <i>Stanislaus</i> is said to be derived from
an Indian chief of that region, who became
Christianized and was baptized under the Spanish
name of <i>Estanislao</i>. He was educated at Mission
San José, but became a renegade, and incited his
tribe against the Spaniards. In 1826 he was defeated
in a fierce battle on the banks of the river
now bearing his name.</p>

<p>Fremont thus describes the scenery along the
Stanislaus: “Issuing from the woods, we rode
about sixteen miles over open prairie partly
covered with bunch grass, the timber re-appearing
on the rolling hills of the River Stanislaus,
in the usual belt of evergreen oaks. The level
valley was about forty feet below the upland,
and the stream seventy yards broad,
with the usual fertile bottom land which
was covered with green grass among large
oaks. We encamped in one of these bottoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in a grove of the large white oaks previously
mentioned.”</p>

<h3>MERCED</h3>

<p><i>Merced</i> (mercy), is the name of the county
south of Stanislaus, of its own principal stream,
and of its county-seat. The river was named by
the Spaniards, in honor of the Virgin, <i>El Río
de Nuestra Señora de la Merced</i> (the river of our
Lady of Mercy). This name was given to the
stream by the Moraga party as an expression of
their joy and gratitude at the sight of its sparkling
waters, after an exhausting journey of forty miles
through a water-less country.</p>

<p>According to Fremont, this stream was called
<i>Auxumne</i> by the Indians: “In about seventeen
miles we reached the Auxumne River, called by
the Mexicans <i>Merced</i>.... We encamped on
the southern side of the river, where broken hills
made a steep bluff, with a narrow bottom. On the
northern side was a low undulating wood and
prairie land, over which a band of about three
hundred elk was slowly coming to water, feeding
as they approached.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The Merced River is notable in that it flows
along the floor of the Yosemite Valley. Like all
the other streams that have their rise in the
Sierras, its character in its upper and lower
reaches is vastly dissimilar. In the days of its
turbulent youth it is a wild and boisterous stream,
and in the voice of its hissing, roaring waters the
wayfarer hears no sound of “mercy,” but after it
makes its tremendous plunge down the western
slope of the Sierras, and debouches upon the floor
of the valley, it takes on a serene air of maturity,
and widens into a placid river, its current flowing
sluggishly between low, level banks.</p>

<h3>MADERA COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Madera</i> (wood, timber), is the name of the
county to the southwest of Stanislaus. It occupies
a stretch of fertile land, and was called <i>Madera</i>
by the Spaniards on account of its heavy growth
of timber.</p>

<h3>FRESNO COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Fresno</i> (ash-tree), so-called in reference to the
abundance of those trees in that region, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
name of a county in the San Joaquín Valley, in
the heart of the grain and fruit country. Raisins
and wine are its especial products. Its capital
city and principal stream also bear the name of
Fresno.</p>

<h3>KINGS COUNTY</h3>

<p>This county, now appearing under its English
form, originally received its name from the river,
which was discovered by a Spanish exploring
party in 1805, and called by them <i>El Río de los
Santos Reyes</i> (the river of the Holy Kings), in
honor of the “three wise men.”</p>

<p>A considerable part of the area of this county
was at one time covered by Tulare Lake, but the
shrinkage of that body of water through the withdrawal
of its sources of supply have added nearly
the whole of the territory occupied by its waters
to the arable land of the county. This subject
is further discussed under the head of Tulare.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The river seems to have been known at one time
as the <i>Lake Fork</i>, by which name Fremont mentions
it in the following paragraph: “We crossed
an open plain still in a southeasterly direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
reaching in about twenty miles the Tulare Lake
river. This is the Lake Fork, one of the largest
and handsomest streams in the valley, being
about one hundred yards broad, and having perhaps
a larger body of fertile lands than any of the
others. It is called by the Mexicans <i>El Río de
los Reyes</i>. The broad alluvial bottoms were well
wooded with several species of oaks. This is the
principal affluent of the Tulare Lake, a strip
of water which receives all the rivers in the
upper or southern end of the valley.”</p>

<h3>TULARE COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Tulare</i> (place of tules, or rushes), is the name of a
county in the south-central part of the state, of
Tulare Lake in Kings County, and of a town in
the San Joaquín Valley. The county is remarkable
for the high mountain peaks of the Sierra Nevada,
on its northeast border. Among these is Mount
Whitney, about 14500 feet in height.</p>

<p><i>Tulare Lake</i>, in Kings County, at one time filled
a shallow depression about thirty miles in length,
and received through a number of small streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the drainage from the southern part of the Sierra
Nevada, soon losing the greater part of this
water by evaporation. It is now practically dry,
as a result of the withdrawal for irrigation purposes
of Kings and Kern Rivers, and the territory
formerly covered by it has been to a great
extent placed under cultivation. The lake was
discovered in 1773 by Commandant Fages,
while hunting for deserters from the presidio at
Monterey, and called by him <i>Los Tules</i> (the
rushes), from the great number of those plants
with which it was filled. In 1813 Captain Moraga
passed through the valley of this lake, and named
it <i>Valle de los Tules</i> (valley of the rushes).</p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Acampo</i> (common pasture), is the name of a
village in San Joaquín County. See Final Index.</p>

<p><i>Arroyo Buenos Aires</i> (creek of the good airs),
is in San Joaquín County.</p>

<p><i>Caliente</i> (hot), is the name of a town in Kern
County.</p>

<p><i>Chico</i> (little), is the name of a town in Butte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
County, ninety-six miles north of Sacramento.
This place derives its name from the Rancho
Chico (the little ranch), of which General John
Bidwell was the original grantee. The Arroyo
Chico and the town both took their names from
the ranch.—(Mr. Charles B. Turrill.)</p>

<p><i>Chowchilla</i>, a large ranch in the San Joaquín
Valley, takes its name from the Chowchilla
Indians, a branch of the Moquelumnan family.
Fremont refers to this name under a somewhat
different spelling: “The springs and streams
hereabout were waters of the <i>Chauchiles</i> and
<i>Mariposas</i> Rivers, and the Indians of this village
belonged to the <i>Chauchiles</i> tribe.”</p>

<p><i>Dos Palos</i> (two sticks, or trees), is in Merced
County, twenty miles southwest of Merced.</p>

<p><i>Esparto</i> (feather-grass), is a town in Yolo
County.</p>

<p><i>Esperanza</i> (hope), is in Kings County, west of
Lake Tulare.</p>

<p><i>Hornitos</i> (little ovens), is in Mariposa County,
sixteen miles northwest of Mariposa. An attempt
has been made to account for this name as a
reference to the intense heat sometimes prevalent
in that region, but the probable origin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
name is that given by Mr. J. P. Gagliardo, a
resident of the place, who says it was derived
“from a number of <i>hornitos</i> built here by the
first settlers, who located here about the early
fifties.” <i>Hornos</i> (ovens), of brick and adobe,
built out-of-doors, and used to bake the bread
for several families, were in very common use
among the first Spanish settlers of California.
Ovens were also used by the Indians, for, instead
of eating their food raw or imperfectly cooked,
they used quite elaborate methods in its preparation.
Their ovens are thus described in the
<i>Handbook of American Indians</i>, by Dr. Pliny E.
Goddard, of the American Museum of Natural
History: “The pit oven, consisting of a hole
excavated in the ground, heated with fire, and
then filled with food, which was covered over and
allowed to cook, was general in America, though
as a rule it was employed only occasionally, and
principally for cooking vegetal substances. This
method of cooking was found necessary to render
acrid or poisonous foods harmless, and starchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
foods saccharine, and as a preliminary in drying
and preserving food for winter use. Most of the
acorn-consuming Indians of California cooked
acorn mush in small sand-pits. The soap-root
was made palatable by cooking it in an earth-covered
heap. The Hupa cook the same plant
for about two days in a large pit lined with
stones, in which a hot fire is maintained until
the stones and surrounding earth are well heated;
the fire is then drawn, the pit lined with leaves
of wild grape and wood sorrel to improve the
flavor of the bulbs, and a quantity of the bulbs
thrown in; leaves are then placed on top, the
whole is covered with earth, and a big fire built
on top.” Mr. Charles B. Turrill states that “the
meal of the ground acorns was placed in shallow
hollows in the sand and water poured on it, by
which means the bitter principle was leached out.
Then the meal was placed in baskets and cooked
by putting hot stones therein. The cooking was
done in the basket, not in the sand.” Other
Indians used pit ovens for baking clams, and the
Panamints of California roasted cactus joints
and mescal in pits. The Pueblo Indians used
dome-shaped ovens of stone plastered with clay,
a form that may have been imitated by the
Spaniards, since their ovens were of that character.</p>

<p><i>Modesto</i> (modest), is the county-seat of Stanislaus
County, and is thirty miles south of Stockton.
According to residents of this town, “The place
was first named Ralston in the year 1870, in
honor of Mr. Ralston, who was then a very
prominent resident of San Francisco, and president
of the Bank of California. He was so modest
that he preferred that some other name be
adopted, so the name was changed to <i>Modesto</i>.”
If this be the true story, it was surely a unique
reason for the naming of a town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oroville</i> (gold-town), is a hybrid word made up
of the Spanish <i>oro</i> (gold), and the French <i>ville</i>
(town). Oroville is the county-seat of Butte
County, and is on the Feather River, in the heart
of a mining and fruit region.</p>

<p><i>Río Vista</i> (river view), is in Solano County, on
the Sacramento River. Modern. Incorrect construction.
It should be <i>Vista del Río</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tehachapi</i>, an Indian word of which the meaning
has not been ascertained, is the name of the
mountain pass in Kern County across the Sierra
Nevada, of which it approximately marks the
southern limit, and of a town in the same county,
thirty-five miles southeast of Bakersfield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the famous Tahichapah Pass was a tribe
called by themselves <i>Ta-hi-cha-pa-han-na</i>, and
by the Kern Indians <i>Ta-hich</i>. This tribe is now
extinct.”—(Powers’ <i>Tribes of California</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Vacaville</i> is situated in a beautiful and fertile
valley in Solano County. It received its name
from a family named <i>Vaca</i>, who were at one time
prominent in that region. Manuel Vaca, the
founder of the family, was a native of New
Mexico, and came to California in 1841. “He
was a hospitable man of good repute.”</p>

<h3>THE SIERRA NEVADA</h3>

<p><i>The Sierra Nevada Mountains</i>, California’s
wonder-land, derive their name from <i>sierra</i> (saw),
and <i>nevada</i> (snowy),—descriptive of the saw-toothed
outlines of the summits of the range, and
the mantle of perpetual snow that covers the
highest tops.</p>

<p>The term <i>Sierra Madre</i>, absurdly translated by
some persons as “Mother of Christ,” means, of
course, “Mother Sierra,” that is, the largest
mountain range personified as the mother of the
smaller ranges.</p>

<p>“The Sierra Nevada is generally considered to
extend from Tehachapi Pass in the south to
Lassen Peak in the north, and constitutes the
dividing ridge between the great basin on the
east, to which it falls abruptly, and the San
Joaquín and Sacramento Valleys on the west.
It is characterized by deep and narrow valleys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
with almost vertical walls of rock thousands of
feet in height, and its scenery is of surpassing
grandeur, much more imposing than that of the
Rockies. Many of its higher summits are covered
with perpetual snow.”—(Lippincott’s
<i>Gazetteer</i>.)</p>

<h3>PIT RIVER</h3>

<p>Among the many tributary streams that carry
the waters of the Sierra Nevada down the western
slope into the Sacramento, the <i>Pit</i>, often incorrectly
spelled <i>Pitt</i>, is one of the most important,
and, although not properly belonging in these
pages, is included for the sake of the information
to be gained concerning Indian customs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives along this river were in the habit
of digging pits near the banks to catch bear and
deer, and, on occasion, even their human enemies.
The pits were dug in the regular trails of animals,
twelve to fourteen feet deep, conical in shape,
with a small opening at the top, covered with
brush and earth. Signs, such as broken twigs,
were placed as a warning to their own people,
and sharp stakes were placed in the bottom to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
impale any creature that might fall in. Another
account of this custom is given in Miller’s <i>Life
Among the Modocs</i>: “Pits from ten to fifteen feet
deep were dug, in which natives caught man and
beast. These man-traps, for such was their
primary use, were small at the mouth, widening
toward the bottom, so that exit was impossible,
even were the victim to escape impalement upon
sharpened elk and deer horns, which were favorably
placed for his reception. The opening was
craftily concealed by means of light sticks, over
which earth was scattered, and the better to
deceive the unwary, travelers’ footprints were
frequently stamped with a moccasin in the loose
soil.” It was from these Indian pits that the
river received its name.</p>

<h3>PLUMAS</h3>

<p><i>Plumas</i> (feathers), is the name of a county in
the northeastern part of the state. It is drained
by the Feather River, which flows through one
of the deepest and most picturesque canyons in
California. The county is characterized by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
wild and rugged scenery, its deep canyons and
extensive forests of evergreen trees. In the
northwest corner Lassen Peak, now an active
volcano, rises to a height of 10437 feet.</p>

<p>The county derives its name from its principal
stream, which now appears under its English
form of <i>The Feather</i>, but which was originally
named <i>El Río de las Plumas</i> (the river of the
feathers), by Captain Luís A. Argüello, who led
an exploring party up the valley in 1820, and
whose attention was attracted by the great number
of feathers of wild fowl floating on the surface
of the river. Even to this day the valley of
the Feather has remained a favorite haunt of the
wild ducks and geese, as will be attested by the
many hunters who seek sport there during the
season. By an inconsistency, the county has
retained the original Spanish name, <i>Plumas</i>,
while that of the river has been Americanized.
An erroneous and extremely far-fetched explanation
of the name has often appeared in print
to the effect that it was derived from a fancied
resemblance between the spray of the river and
a feather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE AMERICAN RIVER</h3>

<p>The <i>American River</i>, another of the names
which have been translated from the original
Spanish, is formed by three forks rising in the
Sierra Nevada, and empties into the Sacramento
at the site of the city of that name. The three
branches forming it run in deep canyons, sometimes
two thousand feet in depth, and the scenery
along its course is of a rugged and striking
character.</p>

<p>The river was originally called <i>El Río de los
Americanos</i> (the river of the Americans), probably
from the presence on its banks of a company
of western trappers, who lived there from 1822 to
1830, and <i>not</i> “because it was the usual route of
travel by which Americans entered the state,”
as is stated by Bancroft and others.</p>

<p>In Fremont’s time it was still known by its
Spanish name, by which he refers to it in the
following paragraph: “Just then a well-dressed
Indian came up, and made his salutations in very
well-spoken Spanish. In answer to our inquiries
he informed us that we were upon the <i>Río de los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Americanos</i>, and that it joined the Sacramento
River about ten miles below. Never did a name
sound more sweetly! We felt ourselves among
our countrymen, for the name of American, in
these distant parts, is applied to the citizens of
the United States.”</p>

<h3>EL DORADO COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>El Dorado</i> (the gilded man). Although it is
known to most people, in a vague, general
way, that the name <i>El Dorado</i> was given to
this county on account of the discovery of
gold there, the romantic tales connected with
the name are probably not so well known. The
Indians of Peru, Venezuela, and New Granada,
perhaps in the hope of inducing their oppressors
to move on, were constantly pointing out to the
Spaniards, first in one direction, then in another,
a land of fabulous riches. This land was said to
have a king, who caused his body to be covered
every morning with gold dust, by means of an
odorous resin. Each evening he washed it off,
as it incommoded his sleep, and each morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
had the gilding process repeated. From this
fable the white men were led to believe that
the country must be rich in gold, and long,
costly, and fruitless expeditions were undertaken
in pursuit of this phantom of <i>El Dorado</i>.
In time the phrase <i>El Dorado</i> came to be applied
to regions where gold and other precious
metals were thought to be plentiful. According
to General Vallejo, one Francisco Orellana, a
companion of the adventurer Pizarro, wrote a
fictitious account of an <i>El Dorado</i> in South
America, “a region of genial clime and never-fading
verdure, abounding in gold and precious
stones, where wine gushed forth from never-ceasing
springs, wheat fields grew ready-baked
loaves of bread, birds already roasted flew among
the trees, and nature was filled with harmony
and sweetness.” Although old Mother Nature
has not yet provided us with “bread ready-baked”
or “birds ready-roasted” in California, her gifts
to her children have been so bountiful that they
may almost be compared to the fabulous tales of
<i>El Dorado</i>, the gilded man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<h3>PLACER COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Placer</i>, the county in the Sierras famous for
its surface gold-mining, has a puzzling name for
which no satisfactory explanation has yet been
found. Although it has been used in Spanish
countries for centuries in the sense of surface
mining, dictionaries remain silent upon the subject.
The theory often advanced that the word
is a contraction of <i>plaza de oro</i> (place of gold),
bears none of the marks of probability, and
another that it means “a river where gold is
found” is not supported by adequate authority.
One old Spanish dictionary gives the meaning
of <i>placer</i> as “a sea bottom, level and of slight
depth, of sand, mud, or stone,” and states also
that the word is sometimes used to designate
places where pearl diving is carried on. It may
be that the word was extended from this usage
to include placer mining, since in that case the
gold is found in shallow pockets near the surface.
This theory is offered here as a mere suggestion.</p>

<p>Placer County has some of the most striking
mountain scenery in the state, and has been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
theatre of many remarkable events in its history,
particularly those connected with the “days of
’49.” In the town of Placerville, the county-seat
of El Dorado County, there is an instance of a
change of name from English to Spanish for the
better, for this place was originally called <i>Hangtown</i>,
in commemoration of the hanging of certain
“bad men” on a tree there.</p>

<h3>THE TRUCKEE RIVER</h3>

<p>The <i>Truckee River</i> rises on the borders of
El Dorado and Placer Counties, and is the outlet
of Lake Tahoe, discharging its waters into Pyramid
Lake in Nevada. This mountain stream is
justly celebrated for the wild charm of its scenery.
There is a village bearing the same name, in
Nevada County, well-known to travelers through
being on the regular route to Tahoe. At this
place winter sports, tobogganing, skiing, skating,
etc., are provided for San Franciscans, who need
to travel but a few hours to exchange their clime
of eternal spring for the deep snows of the Sierras.</p>

<p>The explanation generally accepted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
name of <i>Truckee</i> is that it was so-called for an
Indian, by some accounts described as a Canadian
trapper, who guided a party of explorers in 1844
to its lower crossing, where the town of Wadsworth
now stands. The party, who were suffering
from thirst, felt themselves to be under such
obligations to the Indian for having guided them
to this lovely mountain stream, with its crystal
waters and abundance of fish, that they gave it
his name. Of this Indian it is said that “he joined
Fremont’s battalion, and was afterwards known
as Captain Truckee; he became a great favorite
with Fremont, who gave him a Bible. When he
died he asked to be buried by white men in their
style. The miners dug a grave near Como, in
the croppings of the old Goliah ledge. Here he
was laid to rest, with the Bible by his side.”—(<i>History
of Nevada County.</i>)</p>

<h3>LAKE TAHOE</h3>

<p><i>Tahoe</i> is another of the Indian names whose
meaning can not be ascertained with any degree
of certainty. The definition “Big Water,” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
one usually given, is considered doubtful by
ethnologists. The statement has been made by
intelligent Indians now living on the banks of
the lake that the word, pronounced <i>Dá-o</i> by them,
means “deep” and “blue.” Yet it is much to
know that this pearl among all lakes has at least
been fortunate enough to receive an indigenous
name, escaping by a narrow margin the ignominious
fate of being called Lake Bigler, for a former
governor of the state. It appears that Fremont
was the first to give to this body of water a name,
and it is shown upon his map under the rather
indefinite title of Mountain Lake. Afterward it
was known for a short time as Lake Bigler. The
story goes that in 1859 Dr. Henry de Groot, while
exploring the mountains, learned that <i>tah-oo-ee</i>
meant “a great deal of water,” and from this
Tahoe was evolved as an appropriate name, but
did not become attached to the lake until the
period of the Civil War. During that time the
Reverend Thomas Starr King, the famous “war”
clergyman of San Francisco, visited the lake, and
inspired by indignation against the Democratic
Governor Bigler, whom he regarded as a secessionist,
he definitely christened it <i>Tahoe</i>, for which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
may be grateful to his memory, regardless of the
motives by which he was actuated.</p>

<p>Tahoe is partly in Placer, and partly in El
Dorado, at the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada,
a portion of its waters also extending into the
state of Nevada. It is twenty-two miles long and
ten wide, and has an elevation of 6225 feet above
sea level. It is especially remarkable for its great
depth, being over 1500 feet deep.</p>

<h3>AMADOR COUNTY</h3>

<p><i>Amador</i> (literally “lover”), but in this case a
surname. Amador is the long, narrow county
lying between Calaveras and El Dorado, and was
probably named in honor of the Amador family,
either Don Pedro Amador, or his son, José María.
Pedro Amador is said to have been a “soldier of
fortune” in the Spanish army, who came to California
in 1771. His son, José María, was also a
soldier and a renowned Indian fighter, and was
known to be living as late as 1883.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<h3>CALAVERAS</h3>

<p><i>Calaveras</i> (skulls), is the name of a county in
the central part of the Sierra Nevada, on the
eastern border. This county is famous for its
gold and copper mines, and its Giant Sequoias.
The river, to which the name of Calaveras was
first given, rises in the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada and flows southwest, emptying into the
San Joaquín about fifteen miles below Stockton.</p>

<p>The river received its rather lugubrious name
at the hands of Captain Moraga, who led the
first expedition up the Sacramento and San
Joaquín rivers. In his diary, Moraga says that
the river tribes fought against those of the Sierra
for possession of the salmon in the stream, and
that in one battle as many as three thousand
were said to have been killed and left on the
field. A great number of skulls, relics of this
bloody conflict, were found by Moraga scattered
along the creek bed, and caused him to give it the
name of <i>Las Calaveras</i>. We find in Fremont a
corroborating reference to the salmon as a cause
of dissension among the Indians of that region:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
“This fish had a large share in supporting the
Indians, who raised nothing, but lived on what
nature gave. A ‘salmon water,’ as they named it,
was a valuable possession to a tribe or village,
and jealously preserved as an inheritance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">“ ... pearl among all lakes.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Particular interest was aroused in the Indian
relics of this county some years ago by the finding
of the celebrated “Calaveras skull,” purporting
to have been taken from the Tertiary deposit,
a stratum in which no human remains had ever
before been discovered. A close examination into
the circumstances, however, caused scientists to
look with great doubt upon the assertion that the
skull had been taken from the Tertiary deposit.
In the <i>Handbook of American Indians</i>, published
by the Smithsonian Institute, the following
reference appears: “Remains of aborigines are
plentiful in this county, embedded in ancient
river gravels, from which gold was washed. By
some scientists these remains were thought to
belong to the Tertiary Age, but their resemblance
to the modern Indian makes this doubtful. The
Calaveras skull, still preserved in the Peabody
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, at
Cambridge, Massachusetts, was said to have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
from the gravels of Bald Mountain, at a depth of
130 feet, but there are good reasons for suspecting
that it was derived from one of the limestone
caves so numerous in that region.”</p>

<h3>TUOLUMNE</h3>

<p><i>Tuolumne</i> is the name of the county in the
Sierras just east of Calaveras, and of the river
which rises at the base of the Sierra Nevadas, and
flows into the San Joaquín, twenty-five miles
south of Stockton, a part of its course running
through a deep canyon.</p>

<p>Here we have another of the river names ending
in <i>umne</i>, already discussed under the heading of
<i>Cosumne</i>. As stated before, <i>umne</i> probably means
“people of,” and it is held by some authorities
that the meaning of <i>Tuolumne</i> is “people of the
stone houses, or caves.” Bancroft maintains
this theory, holding that the name is a corruption
of <i>talmalamne</i>, “a group of stone huts or caves, or
collection of wigwams.” Objection has been
raised to this theory on the ground that the
Indians of California were not cave-dwellers, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
universally lived in flimsy huts made of sticks
and grass. This objection is cleared away in some
measure by a very interesting paragraph in the
diary of Padre Pedro Muñoz, who accompanied
the Gabriel Moraga expedition of 1806 into that
region. The passage in question relates: “On
the morning of this day, the expedition went
toward the east along the banks of the river, and
having traveled about six leagues, we came upon
a village called <i>Tautamne</i>. This village is situated
on some steep precipices, inaccessible on account
of their rough rocks. The Indians live in their
<i>sótanos</i> (cellars or caves); they go up and come
down by means of a weak stick, held up by one
of themselves while the one who descends slips
down. They did not wish to come down from
their hiding-places, and for me the ascent was too
difficult. This village probably has about two hundred
souls, judging by the considerable mass which
we repeatedly made out among the rocks and corridors
[or ledges], in the manner of balconies,
which the precipice made.” This meeting with
the cave-dwellers occurred at a spot about six
leagues from the Guadalupe River, after the
expedition had left the Merced. It is not, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
course, to be inferred from this circumstance that
the California Indians were genuine “cliff dwellers,”
but rather that, at least in the mountainous
parts of the state, they may have had the habit
of taking refuge in natural caves from inclement
weather or attacks of enemies.</p>

<p>As to the pronunciation of the word, it is said
that the Indians called it <i>Tu-ah-lúm-ne</i>, rather
than <i>Tuólumne</i>, which is the general usage.</p>

<h3>MARIPOSA</h3>

<p><i>Mariposa</i> (butterfly), is famous as the county
that holds within its borders two of the wonders
of the earth, the Yosemite Valley and the Giant
Sequoias. Some of these trees are three hundred
feet high, thirty feet in diameter, and 2400 years
old, having unfolded their feathery fronds before
Christ came upon the earth. According to Professor
Jepsen, “they are the direct descendants
of the species dominant in the Tertiary Period,”
and thus are a living reminder of the plant life of
that dim and distant past of which the animal
life is pictured for us in the fossil remains of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
mammoth and saber-tooth tiger of the La Brea
asphalt beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus30">
<img src="images/illus30.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MARIPOSA SEQUOIAS.</p>
<p class="caption">“ ... some of these unfolded their feathery fronds before Christ came upon the earth.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every writer who has attempted to
account for the name <i>Mariposa</i> has fallen into
the error of ascribing it to the charming little
flower called the Mariposa lily. Fremont, with
his intense appreciation of the beauty of the wild
flowers covering the whole country with a carpet
of many hues at the time of his passage over the
Sierra, says: “On some of the higher ridges were
fields of a poppy which, fluttering and tremulous
on its long thin stalk, suggests the idea of a
butterfly settling on a flower, and gives to this
flower its name of Mariposa (butterflies), and the
flower extends its name to the stream.” It is
almost a pity to demolish such a pretty story, yet
it is unavoidable, for the true explanation is at
hand in the diary of Padre Muñoz, who accompanied
the Gabriel Moraga expedition of 1806
into the Sierra. He says: “This spot [not far
from the Merced river], was called <i>Las Mariposas</i>
(the butterflies), on account of their great
multitude, especially at night and in the morning,
so much so that they became excessively annoying,
carrying their desire to hide from the rays of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the sun so far that they followed us everywhere,
and one even entered into the ear of one of the
leaders of the expedition, causing him a great deal
of annoyance, and not a little trouble in getting
it out.” This story is corroborated by the fact
that at the present day equally great numbers of
butterflies, equally annoying, swarm through the
mountain forests during a certain part of the
autumn.</p>

<h3>YOSEMITE</h3>

<p><i>Yosemite</i> (grizzly bear, not <i>large</i> grizzly bear,
according to the scientists), said to have been
called <i>Yohamite</i> by the natives, is one of the few
Indian names whose meaning has been ascertained
with a reasonable degree of certainty.
It must be remembered that Yosemite, like most
Indian words, has been greatly corrupted from
its original form, which was <i>u-zú-mai-ti</i>, <i>o-só-mai-ti</i>
or <i>uh-zú-mai-ti</i>, according to the tribe using
it, and the valley was never known by this name
to the Indians, but always as <i>A-wa-ni</i>, from the
name of their principal village. Considering the
great alteration of the name from its native form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
it does not seem to be a matter of vital importance
whether it shall now be used as one word, Yosemite,
or in two words, Yo Semite, although the
latter form was at one time the more general
usage, and is greatly preferred by some persons.
The valley was discovered in 1851 by Major
James D. Savage of the United States army, while
chasing the Indians, who had a bad habit of
sallying forth from their hiding-place in the
valley to commit depredations. The name was
chosen by Dr. L. H. Bunnell, surgeon of the expedition,
who tells the story in his <i>Discovery of
the Yosemite</i>. He gave it the name of an Indian
tribe living there and to whom this name
had been given by other tribes, they calling
themselves <i>Ah-wah-nee</i>. Their chief, Ten-ei-ya,
said that when he was a young man the name
<i>Yosemite</i>, or <i>Yohamite</i>, had been chosen because
the tribe lived in the mountains and valleys which
were the favorite resorts of the bears, and because
his people were expert in killing them. He also
said, perhaps in a spirit of boasting, that the name
was bestowed upon his tribe to express the idea
that they were held in as much fear as the bears.
This band of Indians was said to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
originally composed of outlaws or refugees from
other tribes, and may have well deserved their
evil reputation.</p>

<p>Indian names, few of which can be scientifically
defined, have been given to many peaks and waterfalls
in the valley. In the folder printed by the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company more or less
fanciful definitions are given for these names, for
which there is no foundation in fact except in the
case of Yosemite itself and <i>Hunto</i>, which really
does mean “eye,” though not “<i>watching</i> eye.”
Tenaya Peak was probably named for the Yosemite
chief, Ten-ei-ya. The definition of <i>Pi-wa-ack</i>
as “cataract of diamonds” is absurd on its face,
for a moment’s thought will remind any one that
diamonds were wholly unknown to the Indians
of that time and place.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma-ta</i> (the canyon), a generic word, in explaining
which the Indians held up both hands to denote
perpendicular walls.”—(Powers’ <i>Tribes of
California</i>.)</p>

<p>“<i>Tis-se-yak</i> is the name of an Indian woman who
figured in a legend. The Indian woman cuts her
hair straight across the forehead and allows the
sides to drop along her cheeks, presenting a square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
face, which the Indians account the acme of
female beauty, and they think they discover this
square face in the vast front of South Dome.”—(Powers’
<i>Tribes of California</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Cho-ko-nip-o-deh</i>, translated as “baby basket”
in the Southern Pacific folder, means literally
“dog-place” or “dog-house.”—(Powers’ <i>Tribes of
California</i>.)</p>

<h3>MONO</h3>

<p><i>Mono</i> is the name of a county on the eastern
border of the state, and of the lake near the eastern
base of the Sierra Nevada. This lake is fourteen
miles long and nine miles wide, and is peculiar
in having no outlet, its waters being strongly
saline and alkaline. It lies 6730 feet above sea-level
and is almost completely destitute of animal
life.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>This name, corrupted from <i>Monache</i>, the name
of the Indians of this region, through its resemblance
to the Spanish word <i>mono</i> (monkey), has
been the cause of considerable confusion, and of
a number of extravagant theories, such as the
supposed existence of monkeys in that country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
or the resemblance of the natives to those animals,
but the similarity between the two words is
regarded by ethnologists as purely accidental.
The meaning is obscure, but it is said that the
name was applied to some Shoshonean tribes of
southeastern California by their neighbors on the
west.</p>

<h3>INYO</h3>

<p><i>Inyo</i>, a word of unknown meaning, was the
name of a tribe of Indians in the Sierra. Inyo
County is on the eastern border of the state,
adjacent to Nevada. Its largest stream is the
Owens River, which flows into Owens Lake,
another body of saline water having no outlet.
This county has the unenviable distinction of
containing within its borders the terrible “Death
Valley,” where the bones of so many unfortunates
have been left to whiten under the desert sun,
and which still claims a victim now and then.
This desolate valley is forty miles long, lying far
below the level of the sea, is destitute of all vegetation,
totally without water, subject to terrific
heat, and in all respects well deserves its funereal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
name. Inyo is unique in containing the highest
and lowest points in the United States,
Mount Whitney and Death Valley, within sight
of each other. In other parts of the county the
mountain scenery is of remarkable grandeur, and
the gold mines in which it is unusually rich are
still worked with profit.</p>

<h3>AMARGOSA RIVER</h3>

<p><i>Amargosa</i> (bitter), is the very appropriate
name of a river of Nevada and southeastern
California which flows into Death Valley, sometimes
known also as the Amargosa Desert. The
mountains lying northeast of the river’s upper
course are sometimes called the Amargosa Mountains.
Fremont gives a characteristic picture of
this dreary country in the following paragraph:
“We traveled through a barren district, where a
heavy gale was blowing about the loose sand, and,
after a ride of eight miles, reached a large creek
of salt and bitter water, running in a westerly
direction, to meet the stream bed we had left. It
is called by the Spaniards <i>Amargosa</i>, the bitter
water of the desert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY LIST</h3>

<p><i>Alta</i> (high), is a village in Placer County, sixty-eight
miles northeast of Sacramento, two miles
from the great American Canyon. The altitude
of this place is 3607 feet above sea level. The
name is modern and was only given to the place
after the building of the Central Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p><i>Cerro Gordo</i> (large, thick hill), is the name of a
famous mining camp in Inyo County.</p>

<p><i>Cisco</i> is a town in Placer County, situated at
an altitude of 5934 feet above sea level. Cisco
is a word of disputed origin. It has been said to
be derived from the Algonquin word <i>cisco</i>, meaning
a fish, a sort of oily herring found in the Great
Lakes, but it seems unlikely that such a name
should be transported all the way from the Great
Lakes to the Sierras, especially as no fish of that
kind is to be found there. Other persons believe
the word to be derived from the Spanish <i>cisco</i>
(broken pieces of coal), but for this there appears
to be no legitimate reason. In the <i>History of
Placer County</i> the statement is made that the
town was named for John J. Cisco, at one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
connected with the United States Government,
an explanation which is probably the true one.</p>

<p><i>Esmeralda</i> (emerald), a village in Calaveras

<p><i>Hetch Hetchy</i> is the Indian name of a deep valley
in the Sierra, lying north of the Yosemite, which
will some day cease to be a valley and become a
lake, as the people of San Francisco have succeeded
in obtaining the permission of the United States
Government to turn it into a reservoir for
the city’s water supply. An explanation of the
meaning of the word Hetch Hetchy has been
obtained through the kindness of John Muir,
who says: “I have been informed by mountaineers
who know something of the Indian
language that Hetch Hetchy is the name of a
species of grass that the Tuolumne Indians used
for food, and which grows on the meadow at the
lower end of the valley. The grain, when ripe,
was gathered and beaten out and pounded into
meal in mortars.” The word was originally
spelled <i>Hatchatchie</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lancha Plana</i> (flat-boat), is in Amador County,
and its story is thus told by Mr. Junius Farnsworth,
an old resident of Stockton: “This town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
is located across the Mokelumne River from Poverty
Bar, a name given to a gravel bar in the
river which was exceedingly rich in placer gold,
and to which thousands of early day miners were
attracted. Those who came from the north side
of the Mokelumne centered in Lancha Plana and
reached Poverty Bar by means of a flat-boat, or
flat ferry. The Spanish soon designated the settlement
on the north bank of the river as Lancha
Plana, as it was the point at which the flat-boat
tied up.”</p>

<p><i>Moquelumne</i> is the name of a river which
rises in the high Sierra in Alpine County, flows
southwesterly and empties into the San Joaquín.
The word is a corruption of the Miwok <i>Wakalumitoh</i>,
the Indian name of the river. The
Moquelumne family was made up of an aggregation
of tribes which occupied three sections, one
lying between the Cosumnes and Fresno Rivers,
another in Marin, Sonoma, and Napa Counties,
and a third occupying a small area in the south
end of Lake County. (A. L. Kroeber, in <i>American
Anthrop.</i> VIII, no. 4, 1906.) The Miwoks
constituted the great body of this family, the
different branches of which were connected by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
similarity of languages. The Miwoks are described
as being quite low in the scale of civilization,
and “it has been asserted that this tribe of
Indians ate every variety of living creature
indigenous to their territory except the skunk.
The skins of jack-rabbits were rudely woven
into robes, and they bought bows and arrows
from the mountain Indians for shell money.
Cremation of the dead was usual, and all possessions
of the departed were burned with them.
Their names were never afterward mentioned and
those who bore the same names changed them
for others. Widows covered their faces with
pitch, and the younger women singed their hair
short as a sign of widowhood.”—(<i>Handbook of
American Indians.</i>) <i>Muk-kel</i> was the name of
the principal village of this tribe, and if <i>umne</i> does
in fact mean “people of”, Moquelumne may be
“people of the village of Muk-kel.”</p>

<p><i>Panamint Range</i> of mountains was named for
the Panamint tribe, who belonged to the Shoshonean
family, and lived around the Panamint
Valley, in Inyo County, southeastern California.
Many unfortunate seekers after gold have lost
their lives in this desolate mountain range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pinto Range</i> (painted or spotted range), so-called
because of the variegated colors of the
rocks. This range is in Inyo County.</p>

<p><i>San Andreas</i> (St. Andrew), is the county-seat
of Calaveras County, and is situated near the
Calaveras River, fifty-six miles southeast of
Sacramento. Placer gold mining was at one time
extensively carried on here. St. Andrew, the
patron saint of this place, was the brother of
Simon Peter, and was the first called to be an
apostle. He suffered martyrdom by being crucified,
supposedly on a cross shaped like the one that
bears his name. He is the patron of the Order of
the Golden Fleece, and of the great Order of the
Cross of St. Andrew.—(<i>Stories of the Saints.</i>) San
Andreas is anomalous in being almost the only
Spanish name in the mining district. The circumstances
of its naming have not been ascertained.</p>

<p><i>Sonora</i>, named for the province of Sonora in
Mexico, is the capital of Tuolumne County, and
is situated ninety miles southeast of Sacramento.
It received its name from the large number of
Sonorans from the Mexican province who mined
there in the very early days. This is a mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
period name and has no real connection with
Spanish names.</p>

<p><i>Tenaya Peak</i> in Yosemite Valley is named for
Ten-ei-ya, chief of the Yosemite Indians.</p>

<p><i>Vallecito</i> (little valley), is in Calaveras County,
fifty-five miles northeast of Stockton.</p>

<p><i>Wawona</i>, in Mariposa County, is said by some
authorities to be a Moquelumnan word meaning
“big tree,” but this definition is regarded by
ethnologists with doubt.</p>

<h3>CAMINO REAL</h3>

<p><i>Camino Real</i> (royal road, or the King’s highway).
The Camino Real was the road connecting
the missions, and was the chief means of
intercourse between the different settlements
during the early years of the state’s history.
After American occupation the road fell into
disuse, but at present is being reconstructed along
the old route, with many extensions and branches,
and will, when finished, be one of the finest roads
in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="PRONUNCIATION_OF_SPANISH_NAMES">PRONUNCIATION OF SPANISH NAMES.</h2>

<p>While it scarcely falls within the province of this book
to enter into an elaborate discussion of the matter of pronunciation
of Spanish names, it is thought desirable to
present a few of the simplest rules, with some examples,
so that persons unacquainted with the language may
avoid at least the worst of those pit-falls set for their
inexperienced feet by our nomenclature. It should be
mentioned that in California the Spanish-American usage,
rather than the Castilian, is followed in the pronunciation
of the c and z. The rules of pronunciation quoted here
are those given in Ramsey’s text books, generally regarded
as excellent authority.</p>

<h3>VOWELS.</h3>

<p><i>A</i> sounds like <i>a</i> in <i>ah</i>, midway between the English <i>a</i>
in <i>father</i> and that in <i>fat</i>. Example, <i>Pala</i>, pronounced
<i>Pah´lah</i>.</p>

<p><i>E</i> sounds like <i>a</i> in <i>hay</i>, its sound being slightly varied
according to situation. Example, <i>Rode´o</i>, pronounced
<i>Ro-day´o</i>.</p>

<p><i>I</i> sounds like <i>ee</i> in <i>bee</i>. Example, <i>Vista</i>, pronounced
<i>Vees´tah</i>.</p>

<p><i>O</i> sounds like <i>o</i> in <i>hope</i>. Example, <i>Contra Costa</i>, pronounced
<i>Cone´trah Coast´ah</i>. This name is frequently
mispronounced by using the short sound of <i>o</i>, as in <i>not</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><i>U</i> sounds like <i>u</i> in <i>rule</i>. Example, <i>La Punta</i>, pronounced
<i>La Poon´tah</i>.</p>

<p><i>Y</i>, when a vowel, is equivalent to <i>i</i>. <i>Y</i> is considered a
vowel only when standing alone, as in <i>y</i> (the conjunction
<i>and</i>), or at the end of a word, as in <i>ley</i> (law), but is sometimes
used interchangeably with <i>I</i> at the beginning of a
word, as in <i>San Ysidro</i>, pronounced <i>San Ee-see´dro</i>, and
sometimes spelled <i>Isidro</i>. In other cases it is a consonant
and is pronounced like the <i>y</i> in the English <i>yard</i>.</p>

<h3>CONSONANTS.</h3>

<p>Only those consonant sounds differing from English
usage need be mentioned here.</p>

<p><i>C</i> has two sounds. Before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> it is pronounced like
<i>s</i> in <i>seat</i>, that is, in Spanish-American usage; examples,
<i>Cerro</i>, pronounced <i>Ser´ro</i>, and <i>Cima</i>, pronounced <i>See´mah</i>.
In all other cases <i>c</i> has the sound of <i>k</i>; examples, <i>Carlos</i>,
pronounced <i>Kar´loce</i>, <i>Colorado</i>, pronounced <i>Ko-lo-rah´do</i>
(each <i>o</i> long, as in <i>hope</i>), <i>Cuesta</i>, pronounced <i>Kwes´tah</i>,
and <i>Cruz</i>, pronounced <i>Kroos</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ch</i> has the sound of <i>ch</i> in <i>church</i>. Example, <i>Chico</i>, pronounced
<i>Chee´ko</i>.</p>

<p><i>D</i> is slightly softened, and when occurring between
vowels and at the end of words it is almost like <i>th</i> in <i>then</i>.
Examples, <i>Andrade</i>, pronounced <i>Ahn-drah´-dthay</i>, and
<i>Soledad</i>, pronounced <i>Sole-ay-dadth</i>.</p>

<p><i>G</i> has two sounds. Before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> it has the sound of
strongly aspirated <i>h</i>. Examples, <i>German´</i>, pronounced
<i>Hare-mahn´</i>, and <i>giro</i>, pronounced <i>hee´ro</i>. In all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
cases it sounds like <i>g</i> in <i>go</i>. Examples, <i>Gaviota</i>, <i>Goleta</i>,
<i>Guadalupe</i>, <i>Granada</i>. In <i>gue</i> and <i>gui</i> the <i>u</i> is regularly
silent; exceptions to this rule are marked by the diaeresis,
as in <i>Argüello</i>, pronounced <i>Ar-gwayl´yo</i>, or in Spanish-American,
<i>Ar-gway´yo</i>.</p>

<p><i>H</i> is silent except in the combined character <i>ch</i>. Example,
<i>La Honda</i>, pronounced <i>La On´dah</i>, with long <i>o</i>,
as in <i>hope</i>.</p>

<p><i>J</i> has the sound of strongly aspirated <i>h</i>. Examples,
<i>Pájaro</i>, pronounced <i>Pah´hah-ro</i>, and <i>San José</i>, pronounced
<i>San Ho-say´</i>. This letter is one of the worst stumbling-blocks
in the pronunciation of Spanish names.</p>

<p><i>Ll</i> has the sound of the letters <i>lli</i> in the English <i>million</i>,
but in many parts of Spanish-America it is pronounced
like <i>y</i> in <i>beyond</i>. The latter is not considered an elegant
pronunciation. Example, <i>Vallejo</i>, properly pronounced
<i>Val-yay´ho</i>, but in Spanish-American, <i>Va-yay´ho</i>.</p>

<p><i>N</i> has the sound of the letters <i>ni</i> in the English <i>pinion</i>.
Example, <i>Cañada</i>, pronounced <i>Can-yah´dthah</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q</i> only occurs before <i>ue</i> and <i>ui</i>, and sounds like <i>k</i>, the
following <i>u</i> being always silent. Example, <i>San Quintín</i>,
pronounced <i>San Keen-teen´</i>.</p>

<p><i>S</i> has the hissing sound of <i>s</i> in <i>say</i>, <i>base</i>, and is never
pronounced like <i>sh</i> as in <i>mansion</i>, or <i>z</i> as in <i>rose</i>. Thus in
<i>Santa Rosa</i> the <i>s</i> is sharply hissed and is not pronounced
as <i>Santa Roza</i>.</p>

<p><i>Z</i> is sounded in Spanish-America like sharply hissed <i>s</i>,
as in <i>say</i> or <i>base</i>. Example, <i>Zamora</i>, pronounced <i>Sah-mo´rah</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>A peculiarity of pronunciation common to almost all
Spaniards is the confusion of the <i>b</i> and the <i>v</i> so that one
can hardly be distinguished from the other. Vowel
sounds are pronounced shortly and crisply, never with the
drawling circumflex sound sometimes heard in English.
Without going into the complications of the division of
syllables, it may be stated that the fundamental principle
is to make syllables end in a vowel as far as possible;
examples, <i>Do-lo-res</i> (not <i>Do-lor-es</i>), <i>Sa-li-nas</i> (not <i>Sal-in-as</i>).</p>

<h3>ACCENT.</h3>

<p>All words ending in <i>n</i> or <i>s</i> or a vowel are regularly
accented on the next to the last syllable; examples,
<i>Sausalíto</i>, <i>Altúras</i>, <i>cómen</i>. All others are accented on the
last syllable; examples, <i>San Rafael´</i>, <i>Avenal´</i>. In words
following the above rules no mark is used, but in the
exceptions, which are many, the stress must be indicated
by the written accent. Examples, <i>Portolá</i>, <i>Jolón</i>, <i>Álamo</i>,
<i>Los Ángeles</i>.</p>

<h3>ARTICLES.</h3>

<p>In the Spanish language articles agree with their nouns
in gender and number. The forms of the definite article
are <i>el</i> (singular) and <i>los</i> (plural) for the masculine, <i>la</i>
(singular) and <i>las</i> (plural) for the feminine. Examples,
<i>El Portal</i> (the portal, or gate), <i>Los Gatos</i> (the cats), <i>La
Paz</i> (the peace), <i>Las Vírgenes</i> (the virgins).</p>

<p><i>Abalone</i> (the great sea-snail of the Pacific Coast).
See page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.</p>

<p><i>Acampo</i> (common pasture). See page <a href="#Page_282">282</a>. This
name is used here in the sense of “camp,” and was
given by the Southern Pacific Railroad years ago,
in reference to a camp of wood choppers and
Chinese which was located there.</p>

<p><i>Acolito</i> (acolyte), is in Imperial County.</p>

<p><i>Adelante</i> (onward, forward), now changed to
Napa Junction, is in Napa County. This place was
called <i>Adelante</i> in the hope that its location on
Napa River would cause it to become the principal
city of the valley.</p>

<p><i>Adobe</i> (sun-dried brick).</p>

<p><i>Agua</i> (water), is in very common use in referring
to springs, usually accompanied by a qualifying
adjective. See page <a href="#Page_339">339</a>. This word is usually
mispronounced by Spanish Americans.</p>

<p><i>Agua Amargosa</i> (bitter water). See page <a href="#Page_154">154</a>.</p>

<p><i>Agua Caliente</i> (hot water, hot spring). See
pages <a href="#Page_76">76</a> and <a href="#Page_259">259</a>.</p>

<p><i>Agua Cayendo</i> (falling water).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Agua Dulce</i> (sweet water, fresh water).</p>

<p><i>Agua Fria</i> (cold water, cold spring).</p>

<p><i>Agua Hedionda</i> (stinking water, sulphur spring).</p>

<p><i>Aguaje del Centinela</i> (water hole, or watering
place of the sentinel), the title of a land grant.</p>

<p><i>Agua del Medio</i> (middle spring).</p>

<p><i>Aguajito</i> (little water hole). Near Monterey,
in a delightful little glen, there were a number of
these springs, or water holes, where the women
were in the habit of doing the town washing,
kneeling upon the ground and washing the clothing
directly in the springs. This place was called
<i>Los Aguajitos</i> (the water holes), by the Spanish
residents, and “washerwoman’s canyon” by the
Americans. In the pastoral days of California,
entire families climbed into their ox-carts, made
with solid wooden wheels, and, provided with a
liberal lunch basket, made a picnic of “blue
Monday” under the green trees of <i>Los Aguajitos</i>
canyon. See page <a href="#Page_339">339</a>.</p>

<p><i>Agua Mansa</i> (still water, smooth-running current).
One writer, for what reason does not
appear, defines this as “house water.” This
place is in Southern California, near Colton.</p>

<p><i>Agua Puerca</i> (dirty or muddy water).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Agua Puerca y las Trancas</i> (muddy water and
the bars, or stiles). This was the peculiar title
of a land grant, based, no doubt, upon some
trivial circumstance now forgotten. One writer
has translated it as “water fit for pigs and Frenchmen,”
a gratuitous insult to the French people
of which the Spaniards were not guilty. This
writer evidently mistook the word <i>puerca</i> (muddy
or dirty) for <i>puerca</i> (sow), and by some strange
twist of the imagination, seems to have taken
<i>trancas</i> to mean Frenchmen!</p>

<p><i>Agua Tibia</i> (tepid or warm water, warm spring).
See page <a href="#Page_36">36</a>.</p>

<p><i>Agua de Vida</i> (water of life).</p>

<p><i>Ahwanee</i> (an Indian place name), popularly but
not authentically translated as “a deep or grassy
valley,” is the name of a place in Madera County.</p>

<p>“<i>A-wa-ni</i> was the name of a large village standing
directly at the foot of Yosemite Fall.”—(Powers’
<i>Tribes of California</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Alameda</i> (an avenue shaded by trees, or a
cottonwood grove). This word is derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>

<p><i>Alessandro</i> (Alexander). This place is in Riverside

<p><i>Alhambra</i>, near Los Ángeles, was named for
the famous Alhambra of Spain. The Alhambra
was an ancient palace and fortress of the Moorish
monarchs of Granada in Southern Spain, probably
built between 1248 and 1354. The word
signifies in Arabic “the red,” and was perhaps
given to this building in allusion to the color
of the bricks of which the outer walls are constructed.
“The marvelous beauty of the architecture
of this structure has been greatly injured
by alterations, earthquakes, etc., yet it still
remains the most perfect example of Moorish art
in its final European development.”</p>

<p><i>Anacapa Island.</i> This name is Indian, but the
popular story that it means “vanishing island,
disappearing island,” is probably not authentic.
“<i>Anacapa</i> is a corruption of Vancouver’s Indian

<p><i>Aptos</i> is said to be an Indian name, meaning
“the meeting of two streams,” in reference to

<p><i>Boca</i> (mouth), in this case refers to the mouth
of the Truckee River, in Nevada County.</p>

<p><i>La Boca de la Cañada del Pinole</i> (the mouth of
the valley of the cereal meal). This was a land
grant, which received its peculiar name from the

<p><i>Las Bolsas</i> (the pockets).</p>

<p><i>Bolsa de Chamisal</i> (pocket of the wild cane, or
reeds). The chamisal, sometimes incorrectly
spelled chemisal, is defined in the dictionaries as
wild cane, or reed, but in California, at least, it
is applied to a “shrub attaining a height of six
or eight feet. Its thickets are almost impassable
except by bears or similar animals, as the branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>

<p><i>Bolsa Chica</i> (little pocket).</p>

<p><i>Bolsa de las Escorpinas</i> (pocket of the perch.)</p>

coast of Mendocino County. See page <a href="#Page_259">259</a>.</p>

<p><i>Cádiz</i>, between Needles and Barstow, was
probably named for the well-known Spanish city
of the same name. “In naming the stations on the
Southern Pacific Railroad from Mojave to Needles
going east, an alphabetical order was used, Barstow,
Cádiz, Daggett, etc., until Needles was
reached.”—(Mr. Charles B. Turrill.)</p>

<p><i>Cahto</i>, Mendocino County, Indian, probable
meaning “lake.”</p>

<p><i>Cahuenga</i>, near Los Ángeles, is an Indian name,
that of a former village.</p>

<p><i>Cahuilla</i>, is said to be a corruption of the Indian
word Ka-wia. See page <a href="#Page_78">78</a>.</p>

<p><i>El Cajón</i> (the box, or canyon). The name of
<i>El Cajón</i> was first given to a valley lying about
fifteen miles east of San Diego. The valley comprises
about 16,000 acres of level land entirely
surrounded by hills several hundred feet high,
thus presenting a box-like appearance that gave
rise to its name. See pages <a href="#Page_41">41</a> and <a href="#Page_339">339</a>.</p>

<p><i>Calistoga</i>, see page <a href="#Page_259">259</a>.</p>

<p><i>Calneva</i> and <i>Calvada</i> are two more hybrids,
made up of syllables from California and Nevada.</p>

<p><i>Calor</i>, near the Oregon line, is likely to cause
confusion by its resemblance to the Spanish word
<i>calor</i>, (heat); this Calor is one of those composite
words to which Californians are so regrettably
addicted, and is made up of the first syllables of
California and Oregon.</p>

<p><i>Calpella</i> was named for the chief of a village
situated just south of the present town, near Pomo,
in Mendocino County. The chief’s name was
Kalpela.</p>

<p><i>Calzona</i> is another trap for the unwary, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
its resemblance to the Spanish word <i>calzones</i>
(breeches); it is one more of those border towns
bearing names made up of the syllables of two
state names, in this case, California and Arizona.</p>

<p><i>Camanche</i>, a post town in Calaveras County,
was so-named in honor of the great Camanche,
or Comanche tribe, whose remarkable qualities
are thus described by Father Morfi in his <i>Memorias
de Texas</i>, a document written about the year 1778:
“The Comanche nation is composed of five thousand
fighting men, divided into five tribes, each
with a different name. They are very superior
to all the others in number of people, extent
of the territory that they occupy, modesty of
their dress, hospitality to all who visit them,
humanity towards all captives except Apaches,
and their bravery, which is remarkable even
in the women. They live by hunting and war,
and this wandering disposition is the worst
obstacle to their reduction, for it induces them to
steal. Nevertheless, they are very generous with
what they have, and so proud that one alone is
capable of facing a whole camp of enemies if he
cannot escape without witnesses to his flight.”
Both spellings are used in the original records.</p>

They speak of finding a “large village of many
houses, and among them one extremely large.”
This place is not to be confused with the famous
<i>Casa Grande</i> in Arizona.</p>

<p><i>El Casco</i> (the skull, or outside shell of anything).
See page <a href="#Page_79">79</a>. As <i>casco</i> also has the meaning of
potsherd, or fragment of a broken vessel, a theory
has been deduced that it was so-called because of
a resemblance between the hollow in the hills
where the place is located and a potsherd. This

which are not likely to have any basis in fact.</p>

<p><i>Castac</i>, an Indian word. The Castake was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
of several tribes occupying the country from
Buena Vista and Kern Lakes to the Sierra Nevada
and Coast Range. Castake Lake in the Tejón
Pass region derives its name from this tribe.
According to Professor A. L. Kroeber, <i>castac</i> means
“my eyes.”</p>

<p><i>Castroville</i>, a composite word made up of Castro,
a surname, and the French <i>ville</i> (town). The
Castro family was perhaps the most numerous in
California. Its most prominent member was
General José Castro, of whom Bancroft says:
“The charges against him of mal-treatment of
settlers were unfounded. His conduct was more
honorable, dignified, and consistent than that of
Fremont, and he treated immigrants with uniform
kindness. He was not a very able man, but
energetic, popular, true to his friends, and in
public office fairly honest. An injustice has been
done him in painting him as a cowardly, incompetent
braggart. He was at one time Commandante
General of California.” The town of
Castroville, named for this prominent family,
is near Monterey.</p>

“well.”</p>

<p><i>Cimarrón</i> (wild, unruly). The Spaniards applied
this word to plants or animals indiscriminately,

California, sometimes in reference to wild Indians.
The writer who translated it as “lost river” must
have drawn upon his imagination for that definition.</p>

<p><i>Córdova</i>, near Sacramento. Córdova or Córdoba
is the name of a province of the Argentine

then it may be that the meaning of Cosumne is
“place of fish,” probably referring to salmon
fisheries.</p>

<p><i>Cotate</i>, in Sonoma County, derived its name

<p><i>Juan</i> (John). <i>Juana</i> (Jane).</p>

<p><i>Juárez</i> (a surname). The name of Benito
Juárez, the Mexican patriot who led the national
armies to victory against Maximilian, is one of
which every native of that country must be proud.
This man was a brilliant example of the triumph
of natural genius over tremendous obstacles.
He was of pure native blood, and had so few
advantages in his youth that at the age of twelve
he was still unable to read or write, or even to
speak the Spanish language. Yet, his ambition
once aroused, he succeeded in acquiring a collegiate
education, graduating with the degree of
Bachiller (bachelor in science or art), and later
became President of the Mexican Republic.
Among the early settlers of California is the name
of Cayetano Juárez, who was at one time an official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
at Solano, and who took part in many Indian

examine the arm of the sea that runs to the southeast;
they saw nothing more than two or three
Indians who made no other demonstration than
to weep, for which reason the place was called

Spain celebrated for its exports of grapes, raisins,
oranges, lemons, figs and almonds. As raisins
are among the chief products of this part of
Fresno County, the town of Málaga was so named
from the Spanish province.</p>

<p><i>Manca</i>, or <i>Manka</i>. To prevent the unwary
from falling into the erroneous belief that this
name is Spanish or Indian, the rather humorous
story of Manka is told here. The story goes that it
was named for a German who came there in ’67,
built a little sixteen by twenty-four foot shanty
and sold whiskey. It was his proud boast that in
the fifteen years he ran this business he never
renewed his stock. The inference may be drawn.</p>

<p><i>Manzanita</i> (little apple), a native shrub that

woods. Fremont says of it: “A new and
singular shrub was very frequent to-day. It
branched out near the ground, forming a clump
eight to ten feet high, with pale green leaves of
an oval form, and the body and branches had a
naked appearance as if stripped of the bark, which
is very smooth and thin, of a chocolate color, contrasting
well with the pale green of the leaves.”
Towns in Marin, San Diego, and Tehama Counties
bear the name of <i>Manzanita</i>.</p>

<p>Powers, in his <i>Tribes of California</i>, describes
the method of making manzanita cider practiced
by the Indians, as follows: “After reducing the
berries to flour by pounding, they carefully remove
all the seeds and skins, then soak the flour in
water for a considerable length of time. A squaw
then heaps it up in a little mound, with a crater
in the center, into which she pours a minute
stream of water, allowing it to percolate through.
In this way she gets about a gallon an hour
of a really delicious beverage, clear, cool, clean
and richer than most California apple cider.
As the Indians always drink it up before it
has time to ferment, it is never intoxicating.”
Fremont also mentions this as a very delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>

to corn cultivated by Mexicans, since the California
Indians raised no cultivated crops, but
subsisted entirely on the natural products of the
land. <i>Milpitas</i> is a village in Santa Clara County,
which for some unexplained reason, has come to
be used as a term of derision, the “jumping off

a land grant.</p>

<p><i>Mojave</i>, or <i>Mohave</i>. Mojave, also spelled

contradicted by scientists. In the documents
of the Spanish explorers the Mojaves are
referred to as Amajabas. The Mojave River is

round rock, 600 feet high, situated at the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
to the bay. The name has no reference to its
grey color, as some people imagine, but refers to
its shape—round like a head.</p>

<p><i>Natoma</i>, is a name about which the romanticists
have concocted some pleasing theories upon very
slender foundation. According to scientists it
is a tribal name, indicating direction, a favorite
method of naming among the Indians. It may
mean “north people,” or “up-stream,” or “down-stream,”
or some such term of direction. By a
severe wrench of the imagination, as has been
suggested, it may be considered that “up-stream”
would eventually lead to the mountains, and that
in the mountains there were people, among whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
there were undoubtedly girls, and in this “long-distance”
manner Mr. Joseph Redding’s definition
of Natoma as the “girl from the mountains”
might be evolved, but the imagination is likely
to suffer from such a violent strain. In the same
way, the persons who believe it to mean “clear
water” may have acquired this idea from the
simple fact that the word contains an indirect
reference to the stream in pointing out the direction
of its current. It is disappointing perhaps,
but nevertheless true, that Californian Indian
nomenclature has little of romance behind it.
The Indians usually chose names based upon
practical ideas, most often ideas of direction,
such as “north people,” “south people,” etc.</p>

information about it.</p>

in this case a surname). The exact origin of the
name of this California town has not been ascertained.
The place is in Marin County and as
there was a land grant there called <i>El Rancho de
Novato</i>, the probabilities are that it is a surname
of some family of early settlers.</p>

<p><i>Noyo</i>, is in Mendocino County. It was the
Indian name of a creek, not the one now bearing

According to Bancroft, the character of Pío Pico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
was a mixture of good and bad, in which the good
predominated. “He was abused beyond his
deserts; he was a man of ordinary intelligence and
limited education; of a generous, jovial disposition,
reckless and indolent, fond of cards and women;
disposed to be fair and honorable in transactions,
but not strong enough to avoid being made the
tool of knaves. He did not run away with large
sums of money obtained by sales of missions, as
has been charged.”</p>

of the Vallejos</i>, edited by James H. Wilkins,
San Francisco Bulletin, January, 1914.)</p>

<p><i>Posa</i> (well, pool, also spelled by the Spaniards
<i>pozo</i>, <i>poso</i>). The fact that <i>posa</i> also has the meaning
of “passing bell for the dead” has caused some
rather ludicrous mistakes. For instance, <i>La Posa
de los Ositos</i> (the pool of the little bears), evidently
refers to a place where some bears were seen
drinking, and certainly would be absurd translated
as “the passing bell of the little bears.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>

prevalent among the Indians of burning over large
tracts of land for the purpose of killing the under-brush
and encouraging the growth of grass, which
resulted in attracting game. The diaries of the
Spaniards refer frequently to this custom, and
speak of finding a great deal of country burned
over in this way. One writer has offered to his
astonished readers the translation of <i>La Quemada</i>
as “the over-full, having enough to eat.”</p>

<p><i>San Augustine</i> (properly Agustín), born in

his youth he was so devoted to pleasure that
his mother feared the destruction of his character,”
but he became converted by the preaching
of St. Ambrose, and it is thought that the <i>Te
Deum</i> was composed in honor of the occasion
of his baptism. It is told of him that “while
walking on the sea-shore, lost in meditation
on his great theme, the <i>Discourse on the Trinity</i>,
he saw a little child bringing water and endeavoring
to fill a hole which he had dug in the sand.
Augustine asked him the motive of his labors.
The child said he intended to empty all the water
of the sea into this cavity. ‘Impossible!’ exclaimed
St. Augustine. ‘Not more impossible,’
answered the child, ‘than for thee, O Augustine,
to explain the mystery on which thou art now
meditating.’ St. Augustine is the patron of
theologians and learned men.”—(<i>Stories of the
Saints.</i>)</p>

tradition says he preached from the gospel of
St. Matthew, written by the Evangelist himself,
which he carried always with him, and that it
had power to heal the sick when laid upon their
bosoms. He was seized by the Jews and cruelly

<p><i>San Bernardo</i> (St. Bernard). There were two
saints of this name, one born in 1190 at Fontaine,
and the other in Savoy. The latter, St. Bernard
of Menthon, is famous as the founder of the St.
Bernard hospitals in the Alps, where “the monks,
assisted by their dogs, search out and care for
travelers who are lost in the passes of the mountains,
where the storms are severe, and the cold
intense.”</p>

<p><i>San Emygdio</i>, “English or Latin <i>St. Emygdius</i>,
Bishop and Martyr, feast August 5. The Roman
Martyrology has this on him: ‘St. Emygdius,
Bishop and Martyr, was consecrated Bishop by
Pope St. Marcellus and sent to preach the Gospel
at Ascoli. He received the crown of Martyrdom
for confessing Christ, under Diocletian.’ He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>

<p><i>San Gorgonio</i> Mountains and Pass are in the
Coast Range in Southern California. Their patron
saint, Gorgonius, suffered martyrdom in 304 at
Nicomedia during the persecution of Diocletian.
Gorgonius, who had held a high position in the
Emperor’s household, was subjected to most
frightful torments, and was finally strangled and
his body thrown into the sea. It was, nevertheless,
secured by the Christians and was afterwards
carried to Rome.</p>

<p><i>San Gregorio</i> (St. Gregory). See page <a href="#Page_233">233</a>.</p>

<p><i>San Ignacio</i> (St. Ignatius). St. Ignatius Loyola
was the founder of the order of the Jesuits. “In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
his youth he was a page in the court of Ferdinand
the Catholic, and later a brave and gay soldier.”
He became a permanent cripple through being
severely wounded in both legs. While confined
by these sufferings, he devoted himself to reading
the life of Christ, and was thus induced to take
up religious work. After some years of study, he
induced five men to join him in forming a community
under the title of the “Company of
Jesus,” whose especial duties are “first, preaching;
second, the guidance of souls in confession;
third, the teaching of the young.”</p>

<p><i>San Isidro</i>, also spelled <i>Ysidro</i> (St. Isidore).
There were two saints bearing this name. St.
Isidore the ploughman could neither read nor
write, but performed many miracles. His master
objected to the time wasted by Isidore in prayer,
but his objections were silenced when he found,
upon entering the field one day, the plough being
drawn by two angels, while St. Isidore knelt at
his devotions. The other St. Isidore was Bishop
of Seville, and in the church in that city bearing
his name, there is a “magnificent picture which represents
him dying on the steps of the altar, having
given all his property to the poor.” See page <a href="#Page_341">341</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p><i>San Juan Point</i> (St. John Point). See page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>.</p>

<p><i>San Julián</i> (St. Julian). This seems to have
been a favorite name for saints, since there were
twelve who bore it. Only two, however, are of
special importance, St. Julian Hospitator, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
St. Julian of Rimini. The first had the fearful
misfortune to kill his own father and mother
through an error, and to make reparation, he
built a hospital on the bank of a turbulent stream
in which many persons had been drowned. “He
constantly ferried travelers over the river without
reward, and, one stormy night in winter, when it
seemed that no boat could cross the stream, he
heard a sad cry from the opposite bank. He went
over, and found a youth, who was a leper, dying
from cold and weariness. In spite of his disease
the saint carried him over, and bore him in his
arms to his own bed, and he and his wife tended
him till morning, when the leper rose up, and his
face was transformed into that of an angel, and
he said: ‘Julian, the Lord hath sent me to thee;
for thy penitence is accepted, and thy rest is near
at hand’.... St. Julian is patron saint
of ferrymen and boatmen, of travelers and of
wandering minstrels.” Little is known of St.
Julian of Rimini except that he “endured a prolonged
martyrdom with unfailing courage.”—(<i>Stories
of the Saints.</i>) See page <a href="#Page_340">340</a>.</p>

<p><i>San Justo</i> (St. Justus). Little authentic is
known of this saint, except that he was the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
archbishop of Canterbury, and died there about
627.</p>

<p><i>San Luís Gonzaga</i> (St. Louis Gonzaga). This
saint, also known as St. Aloysius, was the son of a
noble Italian lady, the Marchesa di Castiglione.
“He entered the Society of Jesus when not yet
eighteen years old, and became eminently distinguished
for his learning, piety and good works.
He died at Rome in 1591 of fever, which he contracted
while nursing the sick.”—(<i>Stories of the
Saints.</i>)</p>

<p><i>San Luís Obispo</i> (St. Louis the Bishop). See
pages <a href="#Page_117">117</a> and <a href="#Page_340">340</a>.</p>

<p><i>San Luís Rey</i> (St. Louis the king). See page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>.</p>

<p><i>San Marcial</i> (St. Martial) was the Bishop of
Limoges, and is especially noted for the conversions
he accomplished, in particular that of the
beautiful virgin St. Valerie, who suffered martyrdom
for her faith.</p>

<p><i>San Marcos</i> (St. Mark). “This evangelist was a
disciple of St. Peter. He founded the church at
Alexandria, and on account of his miracles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
heathen accused him of being a magician; and at
length, while celebrating the feast of their god
Serapis, they seized St. Mark and dragged him
through the streets until he died. Then immediately
there fell a storm of hail, and a tempest of
lightning came with it which destroyed his murderers.”
His remains were removed in A. D. 815
to Venice, where the splendid cathedral of St.
Mark was erected over them. Many legends are
told of this saint, among them the story of his
having saved the city of Venice from destruction by
demons, who raised a great storm and came in a
boat for that purpose, but were driven away by St.
Mark, who went to meet them and held up a cross.</p>

<p><i>San Marino</i>, near Los Ángeles, was named for
a saint who was born in Dalmatia in the fourth
century. He was a poor laborer and was employed
in the reconstruction of the bridge of
Rimini. His piety attracted the attention of the
Bishop of Brescia, who ordained him as a deacon.
Marino retired to Mount Titano, and gave himself
up entirely to religious practices. His cell
attracted others, and this was the origin of the
city and republic of San Marino, the smallest
republic in the world.</p>

<p><i>San Nicolás</i> (St. Nicholas). Little that is
authentic can be obtained concerning the history
of this saint, but there are numerous legends of
miracles performed by him, several of them connected
with raising children from the dead, and
similar stories. St. Nicholas is the chief patron
of Russia and of many sea-port towns, and is the
protector against robbers and violence. He is
also the patron of children and schoolboys in particular,
and of poor maidens, sailors, travelers,
and merchants.</p>

<p><i>Santa Rita</i> is the name of a village in Monterey
County, near Salinas. The patron saint of this
place was born at Rocca Porena in 1386 and died
in 1456. Her feast day is May 22, and she is
represented as holding roses, or roses and figs.
When but twelve years of age Santa Rita was compelled
by her parents to marry a cruel, ill-tempered
man. This man was murdered, and after
his death, his widow desired to enter the convent
at Cascia, but was at first refused admission on
account of her widowhood. She was finally
received, however, and so many miracles were
reported to have been performed at her intercession
that she was given in Spain the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
<i>La Santa de los Imposibles</i> (the saint of the impossibilities).</p>

<p><i>Santa Rosa</i> (St. Rose). See page <a href="#Page_246">246</a>.</p>

<p><i>Santa Susana</i> (St. Susanna). This saint, who
was remarkable for her beauty and learning, was
a relative of the Emperor Diocletian, who desired
her as a wife for his adopted son Maximus. St.
Susanna, having made a vow of chastity, refused
this offer, and Diocletian, angered by her refusal,
sent an executioner to kill her in her own house.</p>

<p><i>Santa Teresa</i>, was born at Avila in Castile,
March 28, 1515. During her earliest youth,
through reading the lives of the saints and martyrs,
she formed a desire to take up religious work.
In accordance with this desire, at the age of twenty
years, she entered the convent of Carmelites, and
chose as her life work the reforming of the order
of Mount Carmel, as well as the establishment of
a number of convents for men. It was she who
made the Carmelites go barefoot, or sandalled.
Santa Teresa had distinct literary gifts, and her
history of her life is a work of absorbing interest,
which is still read with genuine pleasure by students
of the literature of Spain. She attained a
position of such authority in that country that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Philip III chose her for its second patron saint,
ranking her next to Santiago (St. James).</p>

<p><i>Santa Ynez.</i> See Santa Inez. See pages <a href="#Page_109">109</a> and
<a href="#Page_341">341</a>.</p>

<p><i>Santa Ysabel</i>, also spelled <i>Isabel</i> (St. Isabella
of France), who founded the convent at Longchamps,
was sister to the saintly King Louis.
She was educated with her brother by their
mother, Blanche of Castile. St. Isabel dedicated
her convent to the “humility of the Blessed Virgin,”
and gave to it all her dowry. As long as the
convent existed the festival of this saint was celebrated
with great splendor. (<i>Stories of the
Saints.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Santiago de Santa Ana</i> (St. James of St. Anne).
Land grant.</p>

<p><i>San Timotéo</i> (St. Timothy). St. Timothy was
the beloved disciple of St. Paul, whom he accompanied
on many journeys. It is said that he was
Bishop of Ephesus, until at the age of eighty years
he suffered the cruel fate of being beaten to death
by pagans.</p>

<p><i>San Tomaso</i> (St. Thomas), was a Galilean
fisherman and one of the apostles. “So great was
his incredulity that he has always been remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
for that rather than for his other characteristics,”
and it was in this way that the familiar
expression “a doubting Thomas” arose. At the
time of the ascension of the Virgin, Thomas
refused to believe in the event, and the legend
relates that in order to convince him the Virgin
dropped her girdle to him from the heavens.
Three other saints also bear this name, St. Thomas
á Becket, the celebrated English historical character;
St. Thomas Aquinas, a grandnephew of
Frederick I and a man of great learning; and St.
Thomas the Almoner, who was so charitable that
“as a child he would take off his own clothes to
give away to children in the street.” It is related
of the last named that he wore the same hat for
twenty-six years, and that his whole life was “but
a grand series of beneficent deeds. When the
hour of his death came he had given away everything
except the pallet on which he lay, and this
was to be given to a jailer who had assisted him
in executing his benevolent designs.” There is
a remarkably beautiful picture of him by Murillo,
representing him as a child, dividing his clothing
among four ragged little ones.</p>

<p><i>San Vicente</i> (St. Vincent). Three saints bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
this name. St. Vincent of Saragosa was martyred
during the persecution of the Christians by
Diocletian. Legend has it that his remains were
guarded by crows or ravens, and when in the year
1147 Alonzo I removed them to Lisbon, two crows
accompanied the vessel, one at the prow and one
at the stern. In pictures St. Vincent is always
represented as accompanied by a crow or raven.
St. Vincent Ferraris was born at Valencia in 1357.
He was a celebrated preacher and missionary,
and “so moved the hearts of his hearers that he
was often obliged to pause that the sobbing and
weeping might subside.” The third of this name,
St. Vincent de Paul, was the son of a Gascon
farmer, and his charities were so various and so
many as to cause his name to be revered by all,
irrespective of religious differences. He established
the Hospital La Madeleine for the Magdalens
of Paris, a foundling hospital, and numerous
other charities. In truth, the practical good done
by this man during his life makes him well worthy
of the title of “saint.”</p>

<p><i>Sequoia</i>, the giant tree of California, was named
for the Cherokee, Sequoyah, who invented an
alphabet for his tribe. Sequoyah, also known as
George Gist, or Guess, was the son of a white
man and a Cherokee woman of mixed blood, and
was, after all, more white man than Indian. He
had a natural genius for mechanical invention,
and, having been crippled for life in a hunting
accident, he occupied his time in devising the
alphabet, which was accepted with such enthusiasm
by his people that every Cherokee, of whatever
age, had learned to read and write in a few
months. Sequoia, although not a place name, is
given here for the interest it may have for tourists
and other persons unacquainted with the origin
of the name of the famous “big trees.”</p>

account of its color, or it may be the namesake of
the <i>Sierra Morena</i> of Spain. The name is sometimes

1819 within ten miles of the Santa Cruz Mission.</p>

<p><i>Soscol.</i> See Suscol.</p>

lot of ground). In the apportionment of land by
the Spaniards a <i>suerte</i> was a cultivable lot of land
granted to colonists near the pueblos and within
the four leagues assigned to the pueblo. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
suerte consisted of two hundred varas of length
and two hundred of breadth, a vara being about
thirty-three inches. Thus one <i>suerte</i> is one lot
(of land), and not, as one writer has translated it,
“one chance.” <i>Dos suertes</i> is two lots.</p>

<p><i>Tasajara</i>, the name of a resort near Monterey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
is probably a corruption of <i>tasajera</i>, a place where
jerked meat is hung up to cure. Tassajara in
Contra Costa County, and Tasajero creek in
Contra Costa and Alameda Counties are probably
different spellings of the same word.</p>

<p><i>Tecolote</i> (owl).</p>

<p><i>Tehachapi.</i> See page <a href="#Page_289">289</a>.</p>

<p><i>Todos Santos</i> (all saints).</p>

<p><i>Todos Santos y San Antonio</i> (all saints and St.
Anthony).</p>

<p><i>Tolenos</i>, in Yolo County, is probably a misspelling
of Yolenos, from the Indian <i>Yolo</i>. See page

adapted from Weitspekw, the name of a spring
in the village. At the site of the present post-office
of Weitchpec was one of the most populous Yurok

<p><i>Yucaipe</i>, in San Bernardino County, is an
Indian place name.</p>

<p><i>Zamora</i>, probably named for the province of
the same name in the ancient kingdom of León, in
Spain. There is an old proverb about this place
which says: “No se ganó Zamora en una hora”
(Zamora was not taken in an hour), the same idea
as expressed in “Rome was not built in a day.”</p>

<p><i>Zapatero Creek</i> (shoemaker creek).</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="ADDENDA">ADDENDA</h2>

<p><i>Las Calabazas</i> means “the squashes” or “the
gourds,” particularly with reference to the wild
gourds that grow in that locality.—(Mr. Charles
F. Lummis.)</p>

<p><i>El Chorro</i> (the gushing stream), is the name of
a creek near San Luís Obispo, and was so named
from a waterfall on its course.</p>

<p><i>Garvanza</i> is a corrupt word, possibly corrupted
from <i>garbanzo</i> (chick-pea). The town name is a
modern one, not given by Spaniards but by tenderfeet,
and there is no known reason for its application.—(Mr.
Charles F. Lummis.)</p>

<p><i>León</i> turns out not to be of Spanish origin.</p>

<p>In a recent publication on a California subject
the definition of <i>Palo Alto</i> is given as “high hill,”
and of <i>Palo Verde</i> as “green hill,” both of which
are, of course, incorrect. Anyone who will take
the trouble to consult an ordinary Spanish dictionary
will find that <i>palo</i> means “stick.” As
stated elsewhere in this book, the Spaniards used
this word in the sense of “tree,” and <i>Palo Alto</i>
consequently means “high tree,” as is fully set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
forth under the heading of this name in these pages.
The meaning of <i>Palo Verde</i> is, of course, “green
tree.”</p>

<p><i>Pecho</i> (breast) Rock is so named from the shape
of the rock.</p>

<p><i>Prado</i> (meadow) is a modern name applied without
much regard for its fitness.—(Mr. Charles F.
Lummis.)</p>

<p><i>Rivera</i> should be spelled with a “b” instead of a
“v.” It means “banks of a stream,” and the name
is given for this reason.—(Mr. Charles F. Lummis.)</p>

<p><i>Serena</i> (serene) is incomplete in this form, as
Spaniards do not use an adjective standing alone
as a place name. It may have been originally <i>La
Ensenada Serena</i> (the serene bay) in reference
to the charming little cove situated there.</p>

<p><i>Triunfo</i> (triumph) is a modern real estate name,
and has no historical significance that can be discovered.—(Mr.
Charles F. Lummis.)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
